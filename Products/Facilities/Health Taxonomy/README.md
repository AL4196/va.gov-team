The audit of A-Z Services pages on each of the 145 websites revealed that each facility website has it’s own unique A-Z Services List and there is significant variation in how each facility names and describes its services. 
- 2018 unique service names result when service names are aggregated
- ~ 1208 unique “Clinical” Service names (i.e., services that are directly related to clinical services -- have a stop code and/or represent the programs and services of clinical professionals and teams). 
- Excluded services like transportation, VSOs, facility services, canteen, service advocacy programs, residency programs, etc.)
- Little convention or consistency in naming and terminology of services across facilities websites
- The lack of consistency in how services are named creates confusion for users across the system
- Makes it difficult to reuse descriptive content about services across the ecosystem and crosslink it appropriately
