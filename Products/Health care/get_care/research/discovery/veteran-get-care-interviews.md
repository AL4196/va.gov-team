## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Caitlin** and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We are here today to get a better understanding of how you get care from VA. This will just be a conversation, you will not need to help us test any tools today. 

Before we start, there are a few things I'd like to mention:

- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.    
- We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the our services better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
- This entire session should take about **45 minutes**. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.
- I’ll be recording audio during this call, so that we capture your experience accurately.--video will not be in use. 
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

Great! Any questions before we get started?

Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. *Start audio and screen recording.*
