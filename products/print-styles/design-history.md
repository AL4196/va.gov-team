### Feedback & Outcomes

#### VSP Design Collaboration Feedback :
Meeting date: 03/11/2020  
Attendees: Jonathan Nelson, Riley Orr, Peggy Gannon, Emily Waggoner, Crystabel Reiter, Jennifer Strickland, Trevor Pierce 

Outcomes<br>
- There was a lot of discussion around how to best display text on the page (to bold or not to bold!)
   - Some folks thought that only headers should be bolded while none of the body text should 
   - Some folks thought that data should be bolded instead of labels 
- Some folks thought that there shouldn't be inline indents under headers for scannability, while others thought the indents promoted scannability
- There was consistent feedback surrounding repeated headers on the _Review submission_ print style sheet
   - This feedback sparked a boarder discussion around the _Review submission_ screen and displaying headers repeatedly
   
- We have designed a version displaying the data with a bolded treatment and a version with only bolded headers and regular type treatment for the body content 
   - Both designs will be evaluated to see which promotes scannability and reduces the amount of ink used when printed
