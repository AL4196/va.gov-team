## Overview
Veterans have expressed interest in being able to print both the Review submission and Confirmation screens while completing forms on VA.gov. Many confirmation screens prompt the veteran to print this page for their records, however there is no current print style design implemented on VA.gov. This causes some strange printing errors. 

The goal is to design the print stylesheet to both follow best practices and standardize print stylesheets across all VA.gov pages.

- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*

- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

## KPIs
- *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
