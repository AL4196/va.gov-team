# Sec 103 Usability Testing Discussion Guide

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're how to find a school is compliant with the law within the GI Bill Comparison Tool on the VA website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.
- 	I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?

- 	Are you wearing headphones today? If so, would it be possible for you to take them off and use your computer or mobile audio? I'm asking so that I can hear your screen reader during the session.

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 10 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1.	Are you currently using or have you ever used your GI Bill education benefits?
2.	What has been your experience with VA payments to your school?
3.	Were you attending classes and receiving education benefits in the fall of 2018? 
  - If yes, do you recall if you had any issues with VA late payments to your school? 
  - If yes, can you tell me a little about what happened?
4.	Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before?


## First Task: Find Section 103 - 15 minutes
-	You have a friend who had to take a loan back in 2018 due to late VA payments for schooling.  You know that the VA has taken steps to keep this from reoccurring, but that schools may have requirements for you to meet.  You’re interested in attending University X, how would you use the Comparison Tool to find out what information University X requires?

Things to watch for:
-	Where does the user initially look for the information?
-	Does the user look under the Institutional Summary section?
-	What, if any, interest does the user show in the “Protection against late VA payments” modal information?
-	Does the user click on the modal for more information?
-	Screen reader: how does the user move throughout the page? (quick tabbing through options, listening to every control/element, etc.)
-	Screen reader: how does the user interact with modals?


## Second Task: Section 103 Content - 10 minutes
-	What does “Protection against late VA payments” mean to you?
-	Have you heard of a Certificate of Eligibility before?  If so, when? Have you submitted one before?
-	Do any other questions come to mind about this?

## Third Task: Additional Criteria - 5 minutes
-	You are also interested in attending University Y and are curious about their Section 103 requirements.  Please locate the Section 103 requirements for this university.
  - What do you think “additional criteria” is?
  - How would you go about finding out more information?

Things to watch for:
-	Does the user click on the modal?
-	Does the user search around anywhere else looking for more information on “additional criteria”?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
-	Do you have general thoughts or feedback on the Comparison Tool that you’d like to share? 
-	We had you look for information on delayed VA payments within the GI Bill Comparison Tool.  If this situation arose in real life where do you think you’d look for information on how to deal with this issue? 
-	Any questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
