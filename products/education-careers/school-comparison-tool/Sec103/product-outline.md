## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement
Chapter 31/33 Veterans and beneficiaries experienced financial difficulties, have gone into debt, and were dropped from classes due to delayed payments by VA to their schools.    
How might we use the GI Bill Comparison Tool to clearly indicate compliance by educational institutions with Sec 103, and what is required so Veterans and beneficiaries don't have to worry that they’ll be fined or dropped from classes if VA is late with payments.  
 
## Desired User Outcomes
- More informed Veteran and beneficiary experience within the Comparison Tool. 
- Less dropped classes and going into debt. 
- Additional data point for Veterans & beneficiaries to use when selecting an educational institution
- Guarantee for Veterans that their education won’t be delayed if their payments are late.
- Potential to alert users of educational institutions that don’t comply with 103  
 
## Undesired User Outcomes
- Confusion among users due to increasing data in CT
- Veteran is unaware that VA payments won’t fully cover expenses and may be fined

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Happy Veterans
- Less complaints for VA to deal with
- Veterans have trust in VA
- Compliance with Federal law

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Beneficiary requests for updates on payment timing

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

## KPIs
- *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
