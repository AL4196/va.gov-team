# Caution Flag on GIBCT & Reduce Veteran Risk - Research Plan

Feb 19, 2019 â€“ March 13, 2020

#### Background
Some Veterans use GI Bill education benefits to attend colleges and universities that are in jeopardy of losing their accreditation for a variety of reason.  These institutions may be on heightened cash monitoring, facing lawsuits for deceptive advertising lawsuit, etc.. By displaying caution flags on the GI Bill Comparison Tool, VA hopes to deter Veterans from exploring schools with cautionary warnings.

#### Problem Statement 
As a GI Bill beneficiary who is comparing institutes of higher learning during the school selection process, I'd like to be aware of which school have received cautionary warnings. I'd like to receive a high quality education at a fully accredited institution of higher learning. 

#### Solution Hypothesis
By enhancing the design and content of the caution flags that appear on the Search Results and School Profile pages of the GI Bill Comparison Tool, potential GI Bill Beneficiaries will be deterred from considering schools with cautionary warnings. In addition, the content changes will help GI Bill beneficiaries better understand the nature of the cautionary warnings.

#### Research Questions

The research is designed to answer the following questions:

##### Caution Flag on Search Results page and School Profile page
* Do the caution flags sufficiently deter GI Bill beneficiaries from exploring schools with cautions? 
* What, if any, content or design modifications would increase the effectiveness of the caution flags?
* Under what circumstances do GI Bill beneficiaries click through to the school profile page to learn more?
* Which flags, if any, are less of a deterrent to GI Bill beneficiaries?
* Do GI Bill beneficiaries feel they receive all of the necessary information at the moment they need it?
* What questions do GI Bill beneficiaries have regarding the content and meaning of the cautions flags?
* Are GI Bill beneficiaries interested in following the links to learn more about the cautions?

##### Reduce Veteran Risk during school section
* How do GI Bill beneficiaries decide which school to attend? <-- Too similar to prior research?
* What resources do GI Bill beneficiaries rely on for information related to the quality of schools?
* What role does the GI Bill Comparison Tool play in the school selection process

#### What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?

Observing that participants are quickly dissuaded from considering schools with cautions as they engage with the GI Bill Comparison Tool will make us feel like the research process has been successful.

#### What kinds of users do we need to talk to answer our questions?

The following users have been identified:
* GI Bill beneficiaries who are interested in obtaining an undergraduate degree and have not yet enrolled in a school.

#### What specific questions do we need to ask on our Usability Testing screener to get the right kinds of users to test the form?

In addition to the standard questions, which ensure a representative mix of participants, the screener should include the following questions and responses to recruit:

* 3-4 Veterans 
* 3-4 Veteran family members who [have been awarded / are eligible for] GI Bill education benefits

### Usability testing screener questions
1.	[Are you eligible for / Have you been awarded] GI Bill education benefits?
  * If yes, to Question 2
  * If no, end call 
2.	Have you enrolled in an undergraduate degree program?
  * If no, would you like to participate?      
  * If yes, end call

#### What kind of user research do we want to conduct?

The following research methods will be used:

* Remote usability testing of a prototype with 6-8 Veterans

#### What testing and recording tools do we need to run the research sessions?

Usability test sessions will be recorded via Zoom

In-person notes will be taken by hand and/or on a computer.

#### What artifacts do we need to support the research effort?

The following artifacts will be developed:
* Veteran Discussion Guide  
* Interactive Prototype

The Discussion Guide will be ready by: February 24, 2020
The Interactive Prototype will be ready by: March 2, 2020
