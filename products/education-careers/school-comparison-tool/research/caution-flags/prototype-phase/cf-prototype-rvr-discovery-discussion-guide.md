# Caution Flag Prototype & Reduce Veteran Risk Discovery - Research Plan - Prototype Research Discussion Guide  

## Introduction 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME]. I also have several colleagues on the line.  They’ll be observing and taking notes to ensure that we capture your feedback accurately. 

We work with a team at the VA that is enhancing the VA.gov website and we're interested in speaking with you today about the process of selecting a college where you can use your GI Bill education benefits. Specifically, we'll be looking at the GI Bill Comparison Tool. We're reviewing the Comparison Tool with students in sessions like this to ensure that it's easy to use.

The entire session should take less than 45 minutes.

Throughout the process, we are interested in hearing your honest opinions. We are in no way testing your knowledge or ability. We just want to hear your ideas and be sure the form meets Veterans’ needs. You are welcome to express any opinions you wish. We welcome your feedback. If for any reason you want to pause or stop the session, please let me know. I'd be happy to do so. Do you have any questions before we get started?

**Recording**

We generally record sessions, in case we need to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. Are you comfortable if I record the audio and screen movements as we talk? 

Great! I'm going to turn the recording on now.  Once it starts, I’ll ask again if you are okay if we record, so we have your verbal consent.

[The meeting host will begin audio and screen recording. When we hear an announcement that it’s started] 

Are you comfortable if I record the audio and screen movements today? Thank you. 

**Warm-up Questions**

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions 

1.	We are curious to know where are you on your educational journey. Have you already decided what you'd like to study and where you'd like to go to school, or are you just starting the process?

2.	As you think about comparing colleges, what 3 factors are most important to you?


**Think Aloud**

While you are going through the site, we ask that you please think aloud and vocalize your thoughts, and decisions. We are interested in your first reaction to each page.  The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.  Thinking aloud may seem strange at first, but it helps us understand what aspects of the design work well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way.

### Scenario 1: GIBCT with full functionality   [Production site]. 

Let's say you've heard good things about Arizona State University's online degree program.  Starting on this page, how would you research Arizona State University?  

**Questions**  
1. What are your thoughts on that process?  

**Prototype**  

So far, we've been looking at the real site.  Now we're going to shift gears and review a clickable prototype that has some new functionality.  

Just so you know, the prototype is a mock-up, rather than a real website.  This means only certain links have been activated and you’ll see pretend data in some areas. In many cases, as soon as you click you'll see an example of what someone might type in the fields.  We do this to save you time and eliminate the need to type.  If you click on something and nothing happens, we can talk about what you expect might happen.

### Scenario 2: School with one warning   [Prototype]  
  
Let's say your friend is studying cybersecurity at Atlantic Institute and you're thinking about enrolling in the same program.  Using this site, how would you learn more about [school name]?  

[Observe whether or not the participant is naturally interested in clicking the record or learning more]  

**Questions**  
1. What were your thoughts when you first noticed the warning message?  
2. As you read the warning message, what thoughts, questions, or reactions come to mind?  
3. What additional information would help you determine whether or not to attend Atlantic Institute?  

&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 

### Scenario 3: School with multiple warnings   [Prototype]  
  
Let's say you've just moved to [City] and would like to compare schools.  Using the comparison tool, how would you find out what schools you might be able to attend in [City]?  

**Questions**  
1. Which of these schools might you consider and why?  
2. What are your thoughts on <Name of school with multiple caution flags>? Might you attend that school? If no, why?  
3. What questions do you have about the warning messages you see on this page?  
4. Under what circumstances might you attend a school with a warning message?  
[If they haven't already, have them click into the profile page]  
5. What are your thought on the warnings you see at the top of the page?  
6. What are your thoughts on the warnings you see further down the page?  

&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 

### Scenario 4: Refine search   [Prototype]  

Looks like there are [56] schools in [City]. Let's say you want to focus your search on specific types of school that meet your criteria, how might you narrow down the list of schools?  

[Let the participant know that on the real site, the number of results will change as they make selections.]  

**Questions**  
1. What are your thoughts on the process of making selections to refine your search?  
2. Did you notice the filter that let's you exclude schools with warnings?  
3. What are your thoughts on this filter?  

&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 


### Task 5: Review Caution Flag Language   [Graphic with pairs of Caution flags]  
There are actually 17 possible flags. We'd like to hear your thoughts on the language of these flags.  Specifically, we'd like to know if you think people would find any of the wording confusing.  Our goal is to make sure each message very easy to understand.  

1. What wording might others find confusing?  
2. Would you like to see the most detailed version on the result page, or would you prefer to click into the school record to see it, if you are interested?
