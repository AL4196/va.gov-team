# Caution Flag Prototype & Reduce Veteran Risk Discovery - Research Plan - Prototype Research Discussion Guide  

## Introduction 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME]. I also have several colleagues on the line.  They’ll be observing and taking notes to ensure that we capture your feedback accurately. 

We work with a team at the VA that is enhancing the VA.gov website.  We're interested in speaking with you today about the process of selecting a college. Specifically, we'll be looking at the GI Bill Comparison Tool on VA.gov. We're reviewing a new feature of the Comparison Tool with people who plan to use their benefits soon to ensure that it's easy to use.

The entire session should take less than 45 minutes.

Throughout the process, we are interested in hearing your honest opinions. We are in no way testing your knowledge or ability. We just want to hear your ideas and be sure the tool meets Veterans’ needs. You are welcome to express any opinions you wish. We welcome your feedback. 

If for any reason you want to pause or stop the session, please let me know. I'd be happy to do so. Do you have any questions before we get started?

**Recording**

We like to record sessions in case we need to double check that we captured your opinions accurately. Are you comfortable if I record the audio and screen movements as we talk? 

Great! I'm going to turn the recording on now.  Once it starts, I’ll ask again if you are okay if we record, so we have your verbal consent.

[The meeting host will begin audio and screen recording.] 

Are you comfortable if I record the audio and screen movements today? Thank you. 


**Warm-up Questions**

Have you done any usability testing before? { if yes: How'd it go? If no: Ok, it's always fun to try something new.  Thanks for signing up! }

As we get started, I have a couple warm-up questions for you.  

1.	We are curious to know where are you on your educational journey. Have you already decided what you'd like to study and where you'd like to go to school, or are you just starting the process?

2. As you think about comparing colleges, what 3 factors are most important to you?

3. When you think about your GI Bill Education benefits, what are a couple words that come to mind? 


**Think Aloud**

For our session today, I'm going to give you a couple tasks to do online.  While you're going through them, it would be really helpful if you'd think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.  

When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way.

&nbsp; 
Ok, let's get started and try it out. 

{ pass control to participant }


### Scenario 1: GIBCT with full functionality   [Production site]. 

Let's say you've heard great things about Arizona State University's online degree program.  Starting on this page, how would you go about finding how much the tuition to Arizona State University would be?  

{ prompt: Remember to think aloud as you go }

**Questions**  

1. What are your thoughts on that process?  

2. Do you have particular thoughts on the Comparison Tool at this point? 

**Prototype**  

So far, we've been looking at the real VA.gov website.  Now we're going to shift gears and review a clickable prototype that has some new functionality.  

Just so you know, the prototype is a mock-up, rather than a real website.  This means only certain links have been activated and you’ll see pretend data in some areas. In some cases, as soon as you click you'll see an example of what someone might type in the fields.  We do this to save you time and eliminate the need for you to type.  If you click something and nothing happens, we can talk about what you expect might happen.



### Scenario 2: School with one warning   [Prototype]  
  
Let's say your friend is studying cybersecurity at Atlantic Institute in Pensacola.  You're thinking about enrolling in the same program.  Walk me through how you'd use the comparison tool to learn more about the Atlantic Institute where your friend is studying.   

**Observe***
* How did the participant react to the caution flag?
* Is the participant naturally interested in clicking the record or learning more about the warning.  

**Questions**  
1. What were your thoughts when you first noticed the warning message?  
2. As you read the warning message, what thoughts, questions, or reactions came to mind?  
3. What additional information would help you determine whether or not to attend Atlantic Institute?  

&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 

### Scenario 3: School with multiple warnings   [Prototype]  
  
Let's say you've just moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and would like to check out schools in your new city.  Using the comparison tool, how would you determine what schools you might be interested in attending there?  

{ Get participant to search results page and have them review the schools }

Let's say you'd seen a lot of advertising for { Brunley Institute of Art }.  How would you go about checking that school out on the Comparison tool? 

**Questions**  
1. Which of these schools might you consider and why?  
2. What are your thoughts on { Name of school with multiple caution flags } ? Might you attend that school? If not, why?  
ALT QUESTION: Let's say you'd seen a lot of advertising for { Brunley Institute of Art }.  How would you go about checking that school out on the Comparison tool? 

3. What questions do you have about the warning messages you see on this page?  
4. Under what circumstances might you attend a school with a warning message?  
{ If they haven't already, have them click into the School Profile page }  
5. What are your thought on the warnings you see at the top of this page?  
{ If they haven't already, have them view the flags in the accordion }  
6. What are your thoughts on the warnings you see further down the page?  

**Observe**
* How did the participant react to the caution flag?
* Did the participant, click the school with the caution?  If yes, to learn more about the school or the caution? 
* On the School Profile page, did the participant automatically click the jump link

&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 

### Scenario 4: Refine search   [Prototype]  

Looks like there are [56] schools in Phoenix. Let's say you want to focus your search on specific types of school that meet your criteria, how might you narrow down the list of schools?  

[Let the participant know that on the real site, the number of results will change as they make selections.]  

**Observe***
* Does the participant understand that the left column controls the right column?
* Does the participant use the exclude schools with warnings filter?

**Questions**  
1. Did you notice the filter that let's you exclude schools with warnings?  
2. What are your thoughts on this filter?  
3. How likely would you be to use this filter?

&nbsp;

**Reducing Veteran Risk: Questions**  
If you're thinking about applying to a school, how might you check to see if they had any of these kinds of cautionary warnings?

If you're thinking of using your GI Bill Benefits at a particular school, what are your thoughts on whether VA could let you know that a school had this type of warning information associated with it? 

How might VA communicate that information to you? 


### Task 5: Review Caution Flag Language   [Graphic with pairs of Caution flags]  
There are actually 17 possible flags. We'd like to hear your thoughts on the language of these flags.  Specifically, we'd like to know if you think people would find any of the wording confusing.  Our goal is to make sure each message very easy to understand.  

1. What wording might others find confusing? 
2. Do any of these warning seem so minor that you might consider going to the school? 
3. Would you like to see the detailed version of the flag on the Search Results page, or would you prefer to click into the School Profile page to see it?
