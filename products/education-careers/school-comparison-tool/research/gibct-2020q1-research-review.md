## Yellow Ribbon

#### EDU Enhancements Deck (2017)
* In addition to indicating that a school participates in the Yellow Ribbon program, the original vision was to display a link to Yellow Ribbon rates under Veteran Programs accordion. 
  * Determine whether the YR rate can be institution-specific.

#### BAH Team GIBCT Research (2019)
* Veterans find determining and understanding Yellow Ribbon benefits challenging.
   * Upon landing on the School Profile page, one user was unsure if the school offered Yellow Ribbon benefits. Later he noticed it did, but had to scroll around for a while to determine this. 
   * Users did not notice the link to the list of Yellow Ribbon Schools. Users were confused by the following Yellow Ribbon alert box.
