# Notes from Scholarly Research on Veteran School Selection #

Abbey, Derek.  Dissertation. “How Navy and Marine Corps Veterans Make Meaning of the College Choice Process in the Post-9/11 GI Bill Era” University of San Diego.  19 May 2019.

## Primary motivation for choosing college/university:
-	Location (Primarily Resident students)
  -	Factors/attachments tie them to a particular area – family, work, assets (own a home)
>	“Ten of the 12 participants focused their exploration on one region or city. Sometimes their reason for this focused search was because they did not want to return to their home region. However, most of the participants had established ties to the region they were in.”

-	Convenience (Primarily Online/Hybrid students)
  - Individuals who are still in military/may experience relocation due to job or other factors. 
>	“The two students that selected and continued their education at hybrid and online programs, selected these programs because the programs provided the flexibility to move and continue their education”

>	“For those without a tie to the region, convenience replaced this influence. Participants striving to complete their degree on active duty or who expected to move, selected programs, like online or hybrid programs, that allowed them to travel or move while continuing their studies with the same institution.”

## Factors in making a decision:
-	Social circle/relationships are a MAJOR influence
>	“10 of the 12 participants sought out and placed significant weight in these relationships while going through the college choice process.”

>	“The search phase for the students that participated in this study did not include an in-depth analysis of multiple programs and was heavily weighted on the input and perceived trust of others”

-	Internet was primary information gathering tool, but was research was cursory
>	“When exploring which university to attend in order to attain their four-year degree, the participants in this study did not conduct in-depth searches. The majority of the participants selected a region or city and then did brief research of local universities using online search engines or websites.”

-	Participants lacked knowledge related to higher education and the benefits they were intending to use
>	“Donald shared that he avoided private colleges because he was not aware of the Yellow Ribbon program”


## Search process:
-	General Process for Finding School: 
	1. Individuals searched by location and/or received recommendation from a social contact.  
	2. Individual confirmed that the institution had the major they were looking for 
	3. Individual applied (in many cases – only applying to ONE institution)
>	 “Although most of the participants attended more than one college, all of the participants only applied to one university when accessing the institution from which they would ultimately strive to attain their four-year degree. The participants decided on the college they wanted to attend, confirmed that it had the degree that they were seeking, and applied without a backup plan for their education”

>	“Participants did verify that their major of interest was offered at the college they were considering. However, the participants simply were confirming that the university offered the major they were interested in studying, it does not appear to be a significant influencing factor.”

-	Most participants did not seek a particular educational model (resident, online, etc.) – instead they focused on what they DIDN’T want (online classes, for-profit institutions).
>	“When the participants were asked if they sought out a specific educational model, most expressed that they wanted to take resident classes or did not seek a specific model. The two participants that applied for an online university and a hybrid university, sought the flexibility of these models because of their potential for traveling or moving while they were still in the military”

>	“More common in the participants’ answers were the models or systems that they were trying to avoid. Multiple students expressed that they did not want to attend an online university and many said that they were avoiding for-profit universities. David said, “I knew I wanted nothing to do with a for-profit institution.” One participant expressed that she did not want to go to a college that was a nationally accredited institution. When asked if she knew the difference between nationally and regionally accredited programs, Lynn expressed, “I just know that [nationally accredited programs] are bad.” Connected to the trusted relationships discussed above, these students avoided these models because someone they trusted told them to not go there, not because they understood the difference between the models they listed and others”
