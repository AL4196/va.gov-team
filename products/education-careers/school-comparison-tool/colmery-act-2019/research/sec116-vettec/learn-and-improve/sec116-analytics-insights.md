## VET TEC Landing Page

#### "Schools" radio button count logic needs to be modified 
The number of School searches seems low, likely because it's selected by default.  Is it possible to include the number of searches that occur without a selection to the "Schools" count?

#### Interest in Preferred Provider Learn More
While there is curiosity around Preferred Providers (143 of 2980 page views), it's fairly modest, or perhaps users intuititve understand the term and do not need to read about it.

## Prior analysis
#### Using Search box to search by state box (11/8/19)

It appears that users are attempting to filter by state using the Search box on the VET TEC Search Results Page.
- 10 California
- 10 Texas
- 6 New York
- 5 Florida
- 5 Virginia
- 3 Oregon
- 2 Washington
- 1 West Virginia

Consider enhancing the SRP to display matching VET TEC records when the users enter a state in the search box. Per @Dan Shawkey "The big lift is capturing the state and converting it to the abbreviation, then adding as a search parameter." Another possible enhancement would be to move the state box closer to the city box for VET TEC.


#### Preferred providers clicked more often (11/8/19)
Users are clicking into preferred VET TEC Providers over non-preferred providers (Oct 1 - 31 metrics).

#### Type of institution selection (10/5/19)
Since the "All" option was removed from the Type of Institution list, leaving "Schools" selected by default, exact metrics can't be determined for how many users selected standard IHLs vs. VET TEC providers for their search. Despite that, a significant percentage of users opted to search for VET TEC providers (Oct 1 - 31 metrics).
