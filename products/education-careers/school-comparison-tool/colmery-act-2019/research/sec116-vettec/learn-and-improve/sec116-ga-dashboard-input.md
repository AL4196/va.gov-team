### Recommendations 
Proposed enhancements to the VET TEC Dashboard in Google Analytics
- Display a graph with the total number of pageviews by month for the last 12 months
- Display a pie chart of the "Most Viewed Provider Sites"
- Display a pie chart of the "Most Viewed Program Profile Pages"
- Display a bar graph of key actions that are part of the VET TEC journey (i.e. conducting VET TEC search, viewing program profile page, viewing provider website, clicking the apply button, etc.)
- Display a heat map of the U.S. that illustrate where users are interested in attending training
- Display a graph with the total number of VET TEC applications by month for the last 12 months
- Move the "What are the top institution types selected on the GIBCT landing page?" widget to the main GIBCT Dashboard.
- Determine whether data from July 30 to Nov 21 will be included when displaying the most popular programs.  During that time, the program that was selected by default was counted as selected even though the user simply selected the provider.
- Update the list of learn more's - "calcBeneficiaryLocationQuestion" and "calcEnrolled" may be IHL Learn more's.
- Display a list of the top inbound links and the ability to see all so we can determine whether users return after clicking provider URLs or the links in the upper right callout.
