**School closings & cautionary warnings**

VA adds a School Closing Flag to institution profiles when we receive notice that a school or campus location will be closing. The institution's record is removed from the GI Bill Comparison Tool when its closing date passes. 

Caution Flags displayed on an institution record indicate VA, or another federal agency like the Department of Education or Department of Defense, has applied increased regulatory or legal scrutiny to that program. VA recommends potential students consider these cautionary warnings before enrolling in the program.

**Cautionary warnings and school closings**

Caution flags displayed on an institution record indicate VA, or another federal agency like the Department of Education or Department of Defense, has applied increased regulatory or legal scrutiny to that program. VA recommends potential students consider these cautionary warnings before enrolling in the program.

When VA receives notice that a school or campus location will be closing, we add a School Closing flag to that institution's profile. Once a school's closing date passes, we update the flag to reflect the closure and eventually remove the institution from the tool during the next system update.
