## Overview
Create a form for the STEM Scholarship that is compliant and delivers digital submission capabilities for OMB form 22-10203.

## Problem Statement
Currently, veterans who are looking to apply for the STEM Scholarship to extend their CH33 benefits must go through the 22-1995 form.  The addition of the STEM scholarship was a temporary solution while decisions on a stand-alone form were made.  

With the inclusion of the STEM scholarship as part of the 22-1995, adjustments were made to try and usher 2 different user types to the correct location.  With the introduction of the separate forms, it will allow for the users to directly complete the form they desire while streamlining the application for both forms.

How might we increase valid submissions of the 22-1995, 22-10203 and streamline the application process for the veterans of the two forms.
 
## Desired User Outcomes
	- Veterans are able to apply for the STEM Scholarship without assistance.

## Undesired User Outcomes
	- TBD
	- TBD

## Desired Business Outcomes
	- Veterans use new form when applying for STEM Scholarship
	- Only veterans who are eligible for the STEM Scholarship complete the form through submission
	- Veterans no longer use the 1995 to apply for the STEM scholarship
	
## Undesired Business Outcomes
	- All veterans apply for the STEM Scholarship regardless of their eligibility for the program.

## Assumptions
	- The OMB form will not change going forward.
	- The form can be completed without needing to involve a SCO in the digital process.
	
## Solution Approach
- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
## KPIs
- *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
--- 
## Go-to-market Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*
	- They will be directed to the new STEM Scholarship form via the wizard instead of to the 22-1995.
	
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*
	- Education Service: project briefings & demos
	- Education Service / Communications: email & social promos about new application process

## Target Launch Date
- *What is your target launch date of your MVP/iteration?*
	- TBD; subject to contract continuation.

- *What is your date for when you'll evaluate impact after launch?*
	- TBD; Ideally a date 1 month after launch. Subject to contract continuation.
