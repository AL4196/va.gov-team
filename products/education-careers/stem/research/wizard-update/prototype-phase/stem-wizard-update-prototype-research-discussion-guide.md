# STEM Wizard Update Discovery Research Discussion Guide 

## Introduction 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME]. I also have a number of colleagues on the line.  They’ll be taking notes to ensure that we capture your feedback accurately. 

We work with a team at the VA that designs online forms. 

Today, we'll be reviewing one of the forms that students use to update educational benefits.

We are reviewing the form with students in sessions like this to ensure that it's easy to use.

The entire session should take about 45 minutes.
Throughout the process, we are interested in hearing your honest opinions. We are in no way testing your knowledge or ability. We just want to hear your ideas and be sure the form meets Veterans’ needs. 
You are welcome to express any opinions you wish. We welcome your feedback.

If for any reason you want to pause or stop the session, please let me know. 

Do you have any questions before we get started?

**Recording**

Lastly, we generally record sessions, in case we need to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? 

Great! I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.  When we hear an announcement that it’s started, I’ll ask again if you are okay if we record the audio so we have your verbal consent.
[The meeting host will begin audio and screen recording.]
Are you comfortable if I record the audio today?
Thank you. Let’s start with a few warm-up questions 

**Warm-up Questions**

1.	What type of degree are you pursuing?

2.	How far through the program are you?

3.  Approximately how many months or years of educational benefit do you have remaining?

4.	[If STEM] Do you have any interest in obtaining a teaching certification after you graduate?

Think Aloud
While you are going through the site, we ask that you Please think aloud and vocalize your thoughts, and decisions as you see each page. We are interested in your first reaction to each page.  
The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.  If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will too. This may seem strange at first, but it helps us understand what you are thinking and helps us so much with our work.
