### Findings

* "So far it seems really straightforward."  P2
* If it was my information, I would definitely check it [on the review page]'
* Would normally take a screenshot - 
* Wonders if she'd receive an email of the confirmation page.  P2
* It was straightforward
	
#### History major with 2 years of benefits
* Skimmed requirements  P2
* Said yes even though history
* [Exit page] "Okay, so it looks like I'm not eligible for it." [Based on the 3 eligibility bullets on the Exit page]  P2
* "[The icons] are very helpful…they give a clear picture of the eligibility criteria and the information that I entered…Yes, I'm receiving benefits.  No, and so on."  P2
* "Would hope the VA would receive their application and would want some sort of confirmation number to be sure…sometimes, stuff gets lost."  P2
* Knows that you must meet 'all 3' of the criteria based on the sentence.  P2
* Would expect to see a pending application in her account if she selected Yes to continue applying.  P2
* If she clicked 'No'] "Maybe the continue button would not be blue.  It might be grayed out."  P2
* [Upon taking the extra step of clicking no and seeing the "Explore other education benefits" button] Okay, alright, that makes sense. Do you want me to click the "Explore other education options". Was eager to click it. Thinks it's useful.  P2
* "The 'Explore other education options" button] would bring me to a new page with a list of Education benefits."  P2
* "It's pretty straightforward and… the language that is used is pretty clear "  P2
* "Have a translate option if the user's second language is English"  P2
* "Have an accessibility option for those who are low vision - have a screen reader option"  P2
* "Have a chat window"  P2 - on va.gov you can by phone - help button on top right - connect by phone or contact. In case someone has questions and they do. Not want to go back to the very beginning of the application
* "Based on what it says, I would think they would deny the application" (haven't exhausted benefits]"  P2
* Would expect to see a (i) to learn more bout stem programs. [hyperlinks on Exit page]  P2
