### Participant Info
* Post-9/11 - none left
* Graduated Last year with major in history with minor in musical studies

### Findings
#### Science major with 4 months left
* Explored whole screen for the words "STEM Scholarship" before selecting the green button.  P3
* Read through the criteria and said "I meet the requirements so I'll click 'Yes'."  P3
* 8:41 - 10:57 rest of app
* "it was pretty streamlined."  P3  
* Easily answered the questions.  P3
* Finding the green "Find your education benefits form" button was the only part where she was slightly confused.  P3
	
#### History major with 2 years left
* [From the wizard copy] "I can see immediately I would not be eligible because you have to have 6 months of benefits remaining."  Noticed the criteria a 2nd time on the top of the STEM page.  
*	Noticed the criteria a 3rd time in the 2nd question.  P3
* [While answering the STEM question] "You should stop because you are a history major and do not qualify."  P3
* "I would not see any benefit [to applying]."   P3
* [When asked what she'd do next on the exit page] I would [select "No"] and click "Explore other education benefits" [unless she wanted to change majors or wait for benefits to run down.]  P3
* Likes "let us determine" rather than "let VA determine" "In a way, it makes it a little more personable…makes it feel a little more tailored to you, rather than a form letter."
* [While looking at the alternative version] "In this case I would click Yes because in a way it's VA's decision t[to determine] what they would like to do."
* "Would want to finish using Post-9/11 benefits before using this scholarship…Would come back at that time [to apply]."
* "If I had 7 months left, that would be different. I would apply because next month, I'm going to have 6 months left. If I had more than that, I would probably wait until…the end of the next semester…or year"
* "Once I said I did not want to let 'VA determine my eligibility' I'd want to see that ['Explore other Education benefits' button] because if I was looking for additional benefits on top of the post-9/11, then that would be helpful. [UX: Maybe she thought that she needed to stop the process from actually happening.]
* Aware that it says all 3 criteria are required , but thinks you could likely apply with 7-8 months left as you'd have 6 months left when it was awarded.
* The criteria is very understandable.
* Copy suggestion for exit page: "If you're interested in in applying later, when you have less than 6 months benefits, then come back again". "That's what I would expect here [on the exit page]."
* [What would you do if you realized you were ineligible on the wizard?] "I wouldn't know at that point that there is the "Explore other education benefits" button towards the end of the application, but I would start … clicking other links on the menu on the left side to see if there was anything that I was eligible for to have greater benefits." 30:11
* "I'm not going to waste my time applying for a scholarship that I know I'm not eligible for…I think it wastes the VA's time to even rubber stamp the application saying, 'What was she thinking applying for this? She should have known that she wasn't eligible'. I don’t like to waste my time or anyone else's time.""I wouldn't want to submit that application which I wasn't eligible for and maybe submit one that I was eligible for…and have the VA look differently at that one because they knew I had submitting this stem scholarship application that I very obviously wasn't eligible for."
* "If the menu was still there, I'd just go up and start clicking in other areas to see if there was another link to click that had other scholarships that I might be eligible for. And failing that, if the menu wasn't there, I'd log out and log back in to reset the whole situation" [UX: showing the button earlier may be valuable and save the user time.]
* "Those 3 criteria are pretty clearly laid out, even on the first page…It's very clear."
* "It still hammers at you 'Are you actually eligible for this?', several times, which is a good thing, I think, because it makes sure that you are actually a STEM major.
