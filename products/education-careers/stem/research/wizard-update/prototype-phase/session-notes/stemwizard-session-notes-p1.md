### Findings
#### Science major with 4 months of benefit left
* Quickly found the STEM Scholarship option in the wizard and successfully applied.  P1
* Quickly read the scholarship eligibility criteria
* Completed the application through submission
* "Didn’t I just [enter my school]?  [School Selection] is a little bit confusing  P1
* "That was a simple process…That was easy."
	
#### History major with 2 years of benefit left
* "Get rid of the 'Applying to'"…[and have]…'Extend Post-9/11 or Fry scholarship benefits with the STEM scholarship' "(Would need to consider implications)
* "I see two 'Applying for' right now"  
* "I see 2 'applying', I'm going to click on the first one."
* "Applying to extend" is similar to "Applying for a new".   P1
* "I have 2 years left and I'm a history major. I don’t fit any of these…so I'd click 'No'…then I'd [go to the]"Other VA education benefits' [page]…"I'd be looking for something that said 'Additional benefits'."  P1
* Sighed when Exit screen appeared. "But If that were me, I would have already said, 'Look, I don't qualify for it.'"   P1
* Decided to continue because he's obstinate
* [What caught his attention on the Exit page?] "Right here [the icons] is where I looked. I saw, check, x - read that, x - read that. Then I read the heading about needing to meet all 3 criteria. That’s when I said, 'Let me be obstinate and click yes."  P1
* The first thing that I saw were these [checkmark and x icons].  The [icons] are definitely prominent enough"  P1
* "If it were me, I would have clicked no and realized that I didn’t have the STEM Scholarship eligibility. [Sounds like he expected to learn he didn’t have it later in the process]
* "Middle one is a bit wordy."
* "There's got to be something that sounds a little bit more professional than 'used up'."
* Remove "are" and start with "Enrolled in a graduate program for STEM or previously earned a STEM degree and pursuing a teaching certificate."  P1
* The VA using this font actually makes it less daunting…every VA website I go to looks less daunting than every other website I go to."  P1
* "[The 'Check your remaining benefits" link] is a big one I'd click on.  P1
* Get rid of "Has used up" and "are" in bullets on the wizard.  P1
* Recommends hyperlinking the ENR STEM Scholarship link in on the wizard.  P1
* No change to the education benefits page.
* Likes that the STEM Scholarship name is linked on the STEM page.  P1
* Has no changes to the STEM questions  P1
* "It was actually pretty easy"
* "I really do think there shouldn't be a button there saying 'do you want to apply?'….If you say no, it should be 'You are not eligible' and there should be a back button…[On exit page]. That [question] should not be there." " It makes it look like I'm continuing the application. Why should I be continuing that application?  If I'm not eligible for it, why am I going to put an application in for it?  Why is the system allowing me to put an application in?...It will end up wasting someone's time…If this thing is about efficiency, why would I want to submit a form?"…now if this generates an application, and someone over at the VA sees this…I think that’s a doggone waste of time.    P1
* "I wouldn't even give them the [option of] saying yes…I would have them put an 'additional benefits' page right down there [on the exit page].[Upon clicking 'No" and seeing the 'Explore other education benefits' button] Ah ha!  P1
* I would like to see [the 'Explore other education benefits' button] earlier."  P1
* Give them the back button, the 'Explore other education benefits" button and git rid of the question.  P1
* "You have to put some kind of control measure in…Would prevent the va from wasting time.]   P1
	

OOS
* Like a typical person I'm not going to review the application...I'm going to click submit."
