# STEM Scholarship Wizard Update - Prototype Research Plan

Jan 21, 2019 – Jan 31, 2020


#### Problem Statement 
As an individual seeking education benefits, I want to understand the eligibility criteria for the STEM scholarship so I can apply if I'm eligible and I don't waste my time applying if I'm not. If I’m currently ineligible, it'd be helpful to know if it's a scholarship I may be eligible for in the future.

#### Solution Hypothesis
By presenting more detailed information about STEM scholarship eligibility criteria in the Education Benefits Wizard and the application, not directing individuals to the STEM application if they're ineligible, and adding ineligibility warnings in the application, we will significantly reduce the 90% rejection rate for the STEM Scholarship.  These efforts to enhance the online application will help applicants better understand the scholarship criteria and discourage those who are ineligible from applying unnecessarily.

#### Research Questions

The research is designed to answer the following questions:

##### Education Benefits Wizard
* Does the new copy clearly describe the STEM Scholarship benefits and convey eligibility requirements?
* What, if any, modifications to the content would make the benefits and eligibility criteria more clear?
* What additional contextual help would ensure users understand their potential eligibility for the STEM Scholarship?
* Does the copy sufficiently deter individuals who are ineligible for the STEM Scholarship from applying?
* Are users who are currently ineligible able to determine under what circumstances they may become eligible in the future?

##### VA Form 22-1995
* Does the new copy clearly describe the STEM Scholarship benefits and convey eligibility requirements?
* What, if any, modifications to the content would make the benefits and eligibility criteria more clear?
* What additional contextual help would ensure users understand their potential eligibility for the STEM Scholarship?
* Does the copy sufficiently deter individuals who are ineligible for the STEM Scholarship from applying?
* Are users who are currently ineligible able to determine under what circumstances they may become eligible in the future?
* Does the copy or the order of the questions encourage ineligible users to apply as the idea of a scholarship is enticing?
*	What confusion do non-STEM applicants experience when seeing the STEM questions on the Request for Change of Program or Place of Training application and how might this confusion be mitigated?


#### What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?

Observing that participants find the contextual help and have few, if any, questions about who is eligible for the scholarship after reading the copy will make us feel like the research process has been successful.

#### What kinds of users do we need to talk to answer our questions?

The following users have been identified:
*	Post 9/11 GI bill Veterans or Fry Scholars who are pursuing an undergraduate degree in STEM field
* Post 9/11 GI bill Veterans or Fry Scholars who have finished a STEM degree and are interested in obtaining a teaching certificate.
*	Post 9/11 GI bill Veterans or Fry Scholars who are studying in non-STEM fields (languages, literature, philosophy, art, religion, history, politics, law, business, etc.)

#### What specific questions do we need to ask on our Usability Testing screener to get the right kinds of users to test the form?

In addition to the standard questions, which ensure a representative mix of participants, the screener should include the following questions and responses:

### To recruit 4 STEM participants and 2 Non-STEM participants
1.	Are you currentley, or have you in the past, used Post-9/11 GI Bill educational benefits to obtain an undergraduate degree?
  * If currently using, to Question 2
  * If already graduated, to Question 3
  * If no, end call 
2.	Are you studying science, technology, engineering or math?
  * If non-STEM, would you like to participate? **<-- 1 of 2 Non-STEM participants
  * If STEM, would you like to participate?   **<-- 1 of 4 STEM participants
3.	Is your degree in science, technology, engineering or math?
  * If Yes, skip to Question 4   
  * If No, end call.
4.	Are you interested in obtaining a teaching certificate?
  * If yes, would you like to participate? **<-- 1 of 4 STEM participants
  * If no, end call.

#### What kind of user research do we want to conduct?

The following research methods will be used:

Remote usability testing of a prototype with:
*	4-6 Veterans (Recruit 4 STEM participants and 2 non-STEM participants)


#### What testing and recording tools do we need to run the research sessions?

Remote Interviews will be recorded via WebEx Usability test sessions will be recorded via WebEx 

In-person notes will be taken by hand and/or on a computer.

#### What artifacts do we need to support the research effort?

The following artifacts will be developed:
* Interactive Prototype
*	Veteran Discussion Guide  

The Interactive Prototype will be ready by: Jan 27, 2020
The Discussion Guide will be ready by: Jan 27, 2020


#### Who will fill the team roles?
* Screener writers: Amy Knox
* Recruiter: Perigean Recruiting Firm
* Discussion guide writer: Theresa McMurdo, Amy Knox
* Moderator: Theresa McMurdo
* Note-taker: Theresa McMurdo, Amy Knox and Cindy Cruz
* Observers: UX Team, Education Services & DEPO (invited)
* Research readout writer: Theresa McMurdo or Amy Knox

#### When do we want to conduct the testing?

Interviews and site review
*	Interview will be conducted - Jan 28th & 29th 2020
*	Usability Testing timeslots will be: 
     * Jan 28: 11AM, 1PM, 3PM, 5PM 
     * Jan 29: 9AM, 11PM, 1PM, 3PM, 5PM 

*	Each session will last no longer than 45 minutes
*	A debrief among team members will be held immediately after each session.
*	Findings from will be synthesized once all sessions have occurred and a findings report will be made.

#### When do we need to start recruiting?

Recruiting needs to be complete by: Jan 27, 2020
