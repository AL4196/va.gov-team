# STEM Scholarship Wizard Update - Prototype Research Plan

Jan 21, 2019 – Jan 31, 2020


#### Problem Statement 
As an individual seeking education benefits, I want to understand the eligibility criteria for the STEM scholarship so I can apply if I'm eligible.  If I’m currently ineligible, I'd like to know up front, before I spend time completing the application. 

#### Solution Hypothesis
By adding detailed eligibility criteria to the Education Benefits Wizard, statically displaying revised copy in the STEM application and adding alerts as ineligible application responses are provided, we will significantly reduce the 90% rejection rate for the STEM Scholarship.  These efforts will help applicants better understand the scholarship criteria and discourage those who are ineligible from applying unnecessarily.

#### Research Questions

The research is designed to answer the following questions:

##### Education Benefits Wizard
* Does the new copy clearly describe the STEM Scholarship eligibility requirements?
* What, if any, modifications to the content or design would make the eligibility criteria more clear?
* What questions do participants have regarding their potential eligibility for the STEM Scholarship?
* Does the copy sufficiently deter individuals who are ineligible for the STEM Scholarship from applying?
* Are ineligible participants able to determine under what circumstances they may become eligible in the future?

##### VA Form 22-1995
* Does the new copy clearly describe the STEM Scholarship eligibility requirements?
* What, if any, modifications to the content or design would make the eligibility criteria more clear?
* What questions do participants have regarding their potential eligibility for the STEM Scholarship?
* Does the copy sufficiently deter individuals who are ineligible for the STEM Scholarship from applying?
* Are ineligible participants able to determine under what circumstances they may become eligible in the future?
* Does the copy or the order of the questions inadvertantly encourage ineligible users to apply for the scholarship?
*	What confusion do non-STEM applicants experience when seeing the STEM questions on the Request for Change of Program or Place of Training application and how might this confusion be mitigated?

#### What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?

Observing that participants are able to quickly and easily determine their eligibility for the scholarship as they engage with the wizard and complete the application will make us feel like the research process has been successful.

#### What kinds of users do we need to talk to answer our questions?

The following users have been identified:
*	Post 9/11 GI bill Veterans or Fry Scholars who are pursuing an undergraduate degree in STEM field
* Post 9/11 GI bill Veterans or Fry Scholars who have finished a STEM degree and are interested in obtaining a teaching certificate.
*	Post 9/11 GI bill Veterans or Fry Scholars who are studying in non-STEM fields (languages, literature, philosophy, art, religion, history, politics, law, business, etc.)

#### What specific questions do we need to ask on our Usability Testing screener to get the right kinds of users to test the form?

In addition to the standard questions, which ensure a representative mix of participants, the screener should include the following questions and responses to recruit:

* 4 STEM participants 
* 2 Non-STEM participants

### Usability testing screener questions
1.	Are you currently using Post-9/11 GI Bill or Fry Scholar benefits to obtain an undergraduate degree, 
   or have you in the past?
  * If currently using, to Question 2
  * If already graduated, to Question 3
  * If no, end call 
2.	Are you studying science, technology, engineering or math?
  * If non-STEM, would you like to participate?   **<-- Potential Non-STEM participant**  
  * If STEM, would you like to participate?       **<-- Potential STEM participant**  
3.	Is your degree in science, technology, engineering or math?
  * If Yes, to Question 4   
  * If No, end call
4.	Are you interested in obtaining a teaching certificate?
  * If yes, would you like to participate?        **<-- Potential STEM participant**  
  * If no, end call

#### What kind of user research do we want to conduct?

The following research methods will be used:

* Remote usability testing of a prototype with 4-6 Veterans (Ideally, 4 STEM participants and 2 non-STEM participants)


#### What testing and recording tools do we need to run the research sessions?

Usability test sessions will be recorded via TBD (WebEx, Zoom, or GoToMeeting)

In-person notes will be taken by hand and/or on a computer.

#### What artifacts do we need to support the research effort?

The following artifacts will be developed:
*	Veteran Discussion Guide  
* Interactive Prototype

The Discussion Guide will be ready by: Jan 27, 2020
The Interactive Prototype will be ready by: Jan 27, 2020

#### Who will fill the team roles?
* Screener writers: Amy Knox
* Recruiter: Perigean Recruiting Firm
* Discussion guide writer: Theresa McMurdo, Amy Knox
* Moderator: Theresa McMurdo
* Note-taker: Theresa McMurdo, Amy Knox and Cindy Cruz
* Observers: UX Team, Education Services & DEPO (invited)
* Research readout writer: Theresa McMurdo or Amy Knox

#### When do we want to conduct the testing?

Interviews and site review
*	Interview will be conducted Jan 28th & 29th 2020
*	Usability Testing timeslots will be: 
     * Jan 28: 11AM, 1PM, 3PM, 5PM 
     * Jan 29: 9AM, 11PM, 1PM, 3PM, 5PM 

*	Each session will last no longer than 45 minutes
*	A debrief among team members will be held immediately after each session.
*	Findings from will be synthesized once all sessions have occurred and a findings report will be made.

#### When do we need to start recruiting?

Recruiting needs to be complete by: Jan 27, 2020
