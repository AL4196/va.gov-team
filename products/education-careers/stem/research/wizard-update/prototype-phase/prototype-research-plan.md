# STEM Scholarship: Education Routing Wizard & VA Form 22-1995 Update - Prototype Research Plan

Jan 21, 2019 – Jan 31, 2020


#### Problem Statement 
As an individual seeking education benefits, I want the eligibility criteria for the STEM scholarship to be prominent so if I’m ineligible, I know there is no need for me to spend time applying. If I am eligible, I'd like to be able to easily find the STEM Scholarship form and complete the application process.  

#### Solution Hypothesis
By making the eligibility criteria more visible and alerting potential applicants when it appears they are ineligible for the scholarship, we will significantly reduce the 90% rejection rate for the STEM Scholarship.  These efforts will help applicants better understand the scholarship criteria and discourage those who are ineligible from applying unnecessarily.

#### Research Questions

The research is designed to answer the following questions:

##### Education Benefits Wizard
* Does the new copy in the wizard effectively describe the STEM Scholarship eligibility requirements?
* If participants are unclear about their potential eligibility for the STEM Scholarship, what additional information should the wizard include to address their questions?
* Does the copy sufficiently deter individuals who are ineligible for the STEM Scholarship from applying?
* Are ineligible participants able to determine under what circumstances they may become eligible in the future?

##### VA Form 22-1995
* Does the new copy within VA Form 22-1995 effectively describe the STEM Scholarship eligibility requirements?
* If participants are unclear about their potential eligibility for the STEM Scholarship, what additional information should the application include to address their questions?  
* Does the copy sufficiently deter individuals who are ineligible for the STEM Scholarship from applying?
* Are ineligible participants able to determine under what circumstances they may become eligible in the future?
* Does the copy or the order of the questions inadvertently encourage ineligible users to apply for the scholarship?
*	Do non-STEM applicants experience confusion upon seeing the STEM questions in the Request for Change of Program or Place of Training application? If so, how might this confusion be mitigated?

#### What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?

Observing that participants are able to quickly and easily determine their eligibility for the scholarship as they engage with the wizard and complete VA Form 22-1995 will make us feel like the research process has been successful.

#### What kinds of users do we need to talk to answer our questions?

The following users have been identified:

•	**Users who are ineligible due to field of study**: Post 9/11 GI bill Veterans or Fry Scholars who are studying in non-STEM fields (languages, literature, philosophy, art, religion, history, politics, law, business, etc.).  
•	**Users who are ineligible due to benefits remaining**: Post 9/11 GI bill Veterans or Fry Scholars who are pursuing an undergraduate degree in STEM field with 8 or more months of benefits remaining.  
•	**Users who are eligible**: Post 9/11 GI bill Veterans or Fry Scholars with 6 months or less of benefits AND who are studying in a STEM field or have finished a STEM degree and are interested in obtaining a teaching certificate.  

#### What specific questions do we need to ask on our Usability Testing screener to get the right kinds of users to test the form?

In addition to the standard questions, which ensure a representative mix of participants, the screener should include the following questions and responses to recruit:

* 2 STEM participants with <= 6 months of education benefit remaining
* 2 STEM participants with >= 8 months of education benefit remaining
* 2 Non-STEM participants

### Usability testing screener questions
1.	Are you currently using Post-9/11 GI Bill or Fry Scholar benefits to obtain an undergraduate degree, 
   or have you in the past?
  * If currently using, to Question 2
  * If already graduated, to Question 3
  * If no, end call 
2.	Are you studying science, technology, engineering or math?
  * If non-STEM, would you like to participate?   **<-- Potential Non-STEM participant**  
  * If STEM, to Question 5  
3.	Is your degree in science, technology, engineering or math?
  * If Yes, to Question 4   
  * If No, end call
4.	Are you interested in obtaining a teaching certificate?
  * If yes, to Question 5 
  * If no, end call
5.	Approximately how many months of education benefits do you have remaining?
  * 6 months or less, would you like to participate?   **<-- Potential STEM with <= 6 months of benefit remaining**  
  * 8 months or more, would you like to participate?   **<-- Potential STEM with => 8 months of benefit remaining**  

#### What kind of user research do we want to conduct?

The following research methods will be used:

* Remote usability testing of a prototype with 4-6 Veterans 

#### What testing and recording tools do we need to run the research sessions?

Usability test sessions will be recorded via TBD (WebEx, Zoom, or GoToMeeting)

In-person notes will be taken by hand and/or on a computer.

#### What artifacts do we need to support the research effort?

The following artifacts will be developed:
*	Veteran Discussion Guide  
* Interactive Prototype

The Discussion Guide will be ready by: Jan 27, 2020
The Interactive Prototype will be ready by: Jan 27, 2020

#### Who will fill the team roles?
* Screener writers: Theresa McMurdo, Amy Knox
* Recruiter: Perigean Recruiting Firm
* Discussion guide writer: Theresa McMurdo, Amy Knox
* Moderator: Theresa McMurdo
* Note-taker: Theresa McMurdo, Amy Knox and Cindy Cruz
* Observers: UX Team, Education Services & DEPO (invited)
* Research readout writer: Theresa McMurdo or Amy Knox

#### When do we want to conduct the testing?

Interviews and site review
*	Interview will be conducted Jan 28th & 29th 2020
*	Usability Testing timeslots will be: 
     * Jan 28: 11AM, 1PM, 3PM, 5PM  
     * Jan 29: 9AM, 11PM, 1PM
     
*	Each session will last no longer than 45 minutes
*	A debrief among team members will be held immediately after each session.
*	Findings from will be synthesized once all sessions have occurred and a findings report will be made.

#### When do we need to start recruiting?

Recruiting needs to be complete by: Jan 27, 2020
