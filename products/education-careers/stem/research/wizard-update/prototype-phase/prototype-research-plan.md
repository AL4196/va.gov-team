# STEM Scholarship Wizard Update - Prototype Research Plan

Jan 21, 2019 – Jan 31, 2020


#### Problem Statement 
As an individual seeking education benefits, I want to understand the eligibility criteria for the STEM scholarship so I can apply if I'm eligible and I don't waste my time applying if I'm not. If I’m currently ineligible, it'd be helpful to know if it's a scholarship I may be eligible for in the future.

#### Solution Hypothesis
By presenting more detailed information about STEM scholarship eligibility criteria in the Education Benefits routing wizard and the application, not directing individuals to the STEM application if they're ineligible, and addition ineligibility warnings in the application, we will reduce the alarmingly high 90% rejection rate for the STEM Scholarship.  These efforts to enhance the online application will help applicants better understand the scholarship criteria and discourage those wh are ineligible from applying unnecessarily.

#### Research Questions

The research is designed to answer the following questions:

Education Benefits Wizard
* Does the new copy clearly describe the STEM Scholarship benefits and convey eligibility requirements?
* What, if any, modifications to the content would make the eligibility criteria more clear?
* What additional contextual help within the wizard would ensure users understand their potential eligibility for the STEM Scholarship?
* Does the copy sufficiently deter individuals who are ineligible for the STEM Scholarship from applying for it?

VA Form 22-1995
* Does the new copy clearly describe the STEM Scholarship benefits and convey eligibility requirements?
* What, if any, modifications to the content would make the eligibility criteria more clear?
* What additional contextual help within the application would ensure users understand their potential eligibility for the STEM Scholarship?
* Does the copy sufficiently deter individuals who are ineligible for the STEM Scholarship from applying for it?
* Does the current order of the questions encourage those who may be interested in scholarships to apply, even though they are ineligible?
*	What confusion do non-STEM applicants experience when seeing the STEM questions on the Request for Change of Program or Place of Training application and how might this confusion be mitigated?


#### What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?

Observing that participants find the contextual help and have few, if any, questions about who is eligible for the scholarship after reading the copy will make us feel like the research process has been successful.

#### What kinds of users do we need to talk to answer our questions?

The following users have been identified:
*	Veterans receiving education benefits, studying in STEM field, with > 6 months of benefits remaining
*	Veterans receiving education benefits, studying in non-STEM fields (languages, literature, philosophy, art, religion, history, politics, law, business, etc.), with any remaining benefits
* Veterans receiving education benefits who are considering changing schools, program of study, or training facility.
* Veterans who have finished a STEM degree and are interested in obtaining a teaching certificate.

#### What specific questions d
o we need to ask on our Usability Testing screener to get the right kinds of users to test the form?

In addition to the standard questions, which ensure a representative mix of participants, the screener should include the following questions and responses:

1.	Have you applied for Post-9/11 GI Bill educational benefits before?
  * If yes, to Question 2
  * If no, end call.
2.	Would the idea of a scholarship that extended VA education benefits be appealing to you?
  * If yes, to Question 3
  * If no, end call.
3.	What is/was your field of study?
  * If STEM, to Question 4
  * If non-STEM, would you like to participate?
4.	How many months of your VA educational benefits remain approximately?
  * If more than 6 months, would you like to participate?
  * If less than 6 months, end call. (Suggest they check out the STEM Scholarship application https://benefits.va.gov/gibill/fgib/stem.asp )


#### What kind of user research do we want to conduct?

#### What testing and recording tools do we need to run the research sessions?

Remote Interviews will be recorded via WebEx Usability test sessions will be recorded via WebEx 

In-person notes will be taken by hand and/or on a computer.

#### What artifacts do we need to support the research effort?

The following artifacts will be developed:
