# STEM Wizard Update Discovery Research Discussion Guide 

## Introduction 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is ________. I also have two colleagues on the line, ________ & ________.  They’ll be taking notes to ensure that we capture your feedback accurately. 

We are interested in speaking with you today because the VA would like to understand more about how military-connected students learn about educational benefits.  

As part of this research, the VA is interested in understanding how students:   
- determine their eligibility for educational benefits, and
- modify their existing benefits.

This week, we are talking with military-connected students in sessions like this to gather feedback on the process of applying for a specific educational benefit.

Do you have any questions before we get started?

Can you see our screen in the WebEx?

**Recording**

We generally record our sessions, in case we need to confirm that we’ve captured people’s opinions accurately
- Are you comfortable if I record the audio and screen movements as we talk today? 
-	Great, I’m going to go ahead and start the recording.
-	Once it’s on, I’ll ask you if it’s okay one more time, as we like to have your verbal consent.  
- [Only if we use our WebEx] There will be a slight pause, then we’ll hear an announcement that the recording has started. 

[Start recording]
Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? 

Thank you. Let’s start with a few questions about your degree program.

**Educational background**

1.	Once you were ready to start school, how did you learn about your eligibility for educational benefits? 

2.  How did you learn about the actual application process?

3.	How did you go about applying for benefits? (paper form, online, worked with SCO, etc) [A bit beyond our scope, however it may help us understand their comfort level with online forms]

4.	What type of degree are you pursuing?

5.	How far through the program are you?

6.	Approximately how many months or years of educational benefit do you have remaining?

7.	[If STEM] Do you have any interest in obtaining a teaching certification after you graduate?


**Set the stage**

[Bring up the Wizard on one of the following pages:
- https://www.va.gov/education/eligibility/
- https://www.va.gov/education/how-to-apply/]

[ Participants may be less inclined to wonder aimlessly if we start on the eligibility page.  
Give the user context on the page we'll be reviewing, then focus in on the section of interest. ]

Let's look at the "How do I apply" section of this page.

Take a moment to read the 2 sentences above the green button and read the title of the green button.

**Questions**  

1.	What would you expect to happen when you click the green "Find your education benefits form" button?

2.	Feel free to click the button.  What are your thoughts on this question? 

3.  What would you expect to happen if you clicked each of the 3 radio buttons?

    a.  Let's explore the radio button options… Could you talk me through what you think “Apply for new benefit” means?  

    b.  What about “Update my current benefits”?  
    
    c. What does “Applying to extend my benefit using the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship” mean to you?  
    [We'll use this question to determine if they’re familiar with “STEM” as an acronym… If they don’t mention “STEM – for science, technology, engineering & math”, ask “What fields of study do you think the scholarship might be focused on?”]


4.  What, if anything, have you heard about the STEM Scholarship? 

    a. [If they've heard of it] Where did hear that?

    b. [If they haven’t heard of the STEM Scholarship] What do you think the STEM scholarship might be?  

5.  What are your thoughts on who might be eligible for the STEM scholarship?

6.	Given the information you have now, how likely would you be to apply for the STEM scholarship?(Consider probing around their thought process for applying or not when they’re not sure if they’d be eligible.) 

7.	If you wanted to learn more about the STEM scholarship and who might be eligible for it, how would you go about doing that? (allow them to explore the site, if relevant)

8.	If you were actually applying for education benefits, what additional information would help you know which option you’d want to choose here?

9.	[If on the Eligibility page] What would you expect to happen if you clicked the "Learn more about how to apply for educational benefits" link?  

Looks like we have 5-10 minutes left, so I want to pause and give my colleagues on the phone an opportunity to ask any questions they may have.

[Additional questions from any observers on the phone]

Do you have any questions for us?

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today. We very much appreciate your willingness to be part of our process.  The insights you shared are very valuable and will help us ensure that future students have all of the information they need to take full advantage of VA educational benefits.
