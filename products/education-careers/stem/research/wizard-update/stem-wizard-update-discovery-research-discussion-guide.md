# STEM Wizard Update Discovery Research Discussion Guide 

## Introduction 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME]. I also have two colleagues on the line, <Name> & <Name>.  They’ll be taking notes to ensure that we capture your feedback accurately. 

The VA is interested in understanding how military-connected students learn about educational benefits.  
As part of this research, they are interested in learning about how students:   
- determine their eligibility for educational benefits
- apply for new benefits and 
- modify their existing benefits.  

This week, we are talking with GI Bill students in sessions like this to gather feedback on one of the web pages in the Education section of the website.

Do you have any questions before we get started?

**Recording**

We generally record our sessions, in case we need to confirm that we’ve captured people’s opinions accurately
- Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? 
-	Great, I’m going to go ahead and start the recording.
-	Once it’s on, I’ll ask you if it’s okay one more time, as we like to have your verbal consent.  
- [Only if we use our WebEx] There will be a slight pause, then we’ll hear an announcement that the recording has started.

Looks like we have 5-10 minutes left, so I want to pause and give my colleagues on the phone an opportunity to ask any questions they may have.
