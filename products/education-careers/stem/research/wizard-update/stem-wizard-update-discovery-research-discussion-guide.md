# STEM Wizard Update Discovery Research Discussion Guide 

## Introduction 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is ________. I also have two colleagues on the line, ________ & ________.  They’ll be taking notes to ensure that we capture your feedback accurately. 

We are interested in speaking with you today because the VA would like to understand more about how military-connected students learn about educational benefits.  

As part of this research, the VA is interested in understanding how students:   
- determine their eligibility for educational benefits,
- apply for new benefits, and
- modify their existing benefits.

This week, we are talking with military-connected students in sessions like this to gather feedback on one of the pages in the Education section of the website.

Do you have any questions before we get started?

Can you see our screen in the WebEx?

**Recording**

We generally record our sessions, in case we need to confirm that we’ve captured people’s opinions accurately
- Are you comfortable if I record the audio and screen movements as we talk today? 
-	Great, I’m going to go ahead and start the recording.
-	Once it’s on, I’ll ask you if it’s okay one more time, as we like to have your verbal consent.  
- [Only if we use our WebEx] There will be a slight pause, then we’ll hear an announcement that the recording has started.

Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? 

Thank you. Let’s start with a few questions about your degree program.

**Educational background**

**Set the stage**

[Bring up the Wizard on one of the following pages:
- https://www.va.gov/education/eligibility/
- https://www.va.gov/education/how-to-apply/]

[ Participants may be less inclined to wonder aimlessly if we start on the eligibility page.  
Give the user context on the page we'll be reviewing, then focus in on the section of interest. ]

Let's look at the "How do I apply" section of this page.

Take a moment to read the 2 sentences above the green button and read the title of the green button.

**Questions**  

1.	What would you expect to happen when you click the green "Find your education benefits form" button?

2.	Feel free to click the button.  What are your thoughts on this question? 

3.  What would you expect to happen if you clicked each of the 3 radio buttons?

4.  What, if anything, have you heard about the STEM Scholarship? [If applicable, where did hear that?]

5.  How likely would you be to apply for the STEM scholarship?

5.  Who do you think would be eligible for the STEM scholarship?

6.  How likely is it that people will have heard of the acronym "STEM" before? 

7.  What modifications to the site would help you learn more about the STEM scholarship and who might be eligible for it? 

7.  What additional information would you like to see on this page?

8.	What would you expect to happen if you clicked the "Learn more about how to apply for educational benefits" link?


Looks like we have 5-10 minutes left, so I want to pause and give my colleagues on the phone an opportunity to ask any questions they may have.
