# STEM Wizard Update Discovery Research Discussion Guide 

## Introduction 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME]. I also have two colleagues on the line, <Name> & <Name>.  They’ll be taking notes to ensure that we capture your feedback accurately. 

Today we'll be reviewing VA Form 22-1995 which allows students to update your educational benefits.

We are reviewing the online version of the form with students in sessions like this to ensure that it's easy to use, regardless of what type of change they would like to make.

Do you have any questions before we get started?

**Recording**

We generally record our sessions, in case we need to confirm that we’ve captured people’s opinions accurately
-  Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? 
-	Great, I’m going to go ahead and start the recording.
-	Once it’s on, I’ll ask you if it’s okay one more time, as we like to have your verbal consent.  
- [Only if we use our WebEx] There will be a slight pause, then we’ll hear an announcement that the recording has started.

# Alternative approach 

## Introduction 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME]. I also have two colleagues on the line, <Name> & <Name>.  They’ll be taking notes to ensure that we capture your feedback accurately. 

As you may have heard, the VA launched the new Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship program last fall. We’re interested in speaking with you today to get your feedback on the scholarship application process.  

The scholarship provides up to 9 months of additional Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to qualifying Veterans and Fry Scholars who are seeking an undergraduate STEM degree, or to those who have already earned a STEM degree and now want to obtain a teaching certificate.

We are reviewing the online scholarship application process with students in sessions like this to ensure that the website provides students with all of the information they need to easily determine whether they are eligible to apply. We’d like to walk through the process with you and hear any thoughts you may have to be sure the application process is designed in an effective way. 

Do you have any questions before we get started?
