### Participant Info
* Pursuing a Masters in Cybersecurity.  
* Has about 1.5 years of Post-9/11 left.  
* Has not heard of the STEM Scholarship before, but know a bill was recently passed to extend GI Bill benefits past the original amount.
* Works for a technology company
	
### Findings
* Knows what STEM stands for and expects those in college or with school age children are familiar with the acronym.  
* Would like a hyperlink to content within the VA website or a mouse-over where more information comes down.  
* Curious to know
	• "Is it something I would be eligible for?"
	• "Would I be eligible for the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship?"
	• "Knowing that I'm in a cybersecurity program…is that something that is applicable to me?"
	• "What is it?" 
* Would want the Learn more to appear sooner in the process.  
* Would want to know whether the scholarship can be used in conjunction with GI Bill benefits.  
* Would want to be reassured that applying for the scholarship would not disqualify one from using GI Bill benefits.  
* Quickly realizes the scholarship is not for graduate studies.  
* Wonders why it say you "may be" eligible. Why would I not qualify?  
* Wouldn’t apply without being sure he'd be eligible.  
* Instinctually knew how to use the Learn more.  
* The 3rd radio button is for "extending [benefits] based on a scholarship I would like to do."
* Would want to know that he's eligible before applying
* Would take a fair amount of time or call someone to determine his eligibility before applying

### Quotes
* "It would be helpful for me if that was a hyperlink."
* "You could do like a mouse-over. When you mouse over it information would come down and give you an idea of what that is."
* For me, the [Learn more] should be further back [in the process]."
* "It would be a waste of my time if I said I wanted to apply but I'm not eligible…I'm not a big fan of applying for things * I'm not eligible for, so I'd like to know beforehand"
* "If you are pulling VA Benefits you are not authorized to receive any other scholarships. I'm making an assumption that since this is through the VA there will not be a conflict [with using both GI Bill benefits and the STEM scholarship].The last thing you want to do is loose your benefits because you took a different scholarship."
* Regarding the learn more copy, "I like it…I think it's straightforward and tells you exactly what it is and how much you get."
* "I'm curious why it says 'may qualify'….why would I not qualify for it?"
* When in school, "VA said I would loose my eligibility if I took a scholarship"


### OOS, Related to Wizard
* Apply would let you apply for a new benefit.  
* Update - Don't know why you would update.  Why would I update my educational benefits.  

### OOS
* Would sign in first so he could complete forms 
* Would expect to see what benefits he's eligible for - Post-9/11, Montgomery, etc.
* 1st - would use to apply for new benefits
* 2nd - "Don’t know what you would update, honestly…Why would I be updating my current education benefits? You are either eligible for them or not."
* Would highlight ENRSS and open up a new window and google search it.
* A lot of sites are not good at bringing you back to where you were.
* Wonders "How does that new [Forever GI Bill] legislation effect my current benefits?"
