### Findings
* Thinks "Apply to extend my benefit" is for those who are already in school.  P1

* Knew the exact definition of STEM - all 4 areas of study.  P1
* KEY: Wondered if those on the Montgomery bill were eligible for the STEM scholarship.  P1 
* KEY: Wondered if you'd be eligible if you've already graduated with a degree.  P1 
* Would like the STEM Scholarship to be hot-linked with background information. Would like to know more with a hotlink.  P1
* Wondered what classes could I take to make my current degree stem-focused?  P1

* Wondered if vocational tech programs and robotics would be covered.  P1
