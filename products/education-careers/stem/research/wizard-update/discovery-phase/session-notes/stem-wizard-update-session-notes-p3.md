### Participant Info
* Was told he could not use his Mongomery GI Bill educational benefits in 2002. 
* Has an interest in science per the screener. 
* Interested in doing something else with no immediate plans to return to school as he has a lot of life going on.  
	
### Findings
* Understands that the 3rd radio button allows you to apply for something specific.  
* Unfamiliar with the STEM Scholarship - thinks it might be "a grant thing" for "additional benefits".  
* Speculates that the "STEM Scholarship" may relate to Stem cell research.  
* People would know what [STEM] means if they are extending their benefit for it.  
* Would have extra information right beside the question or below it. Show it just for people who want to know more about it.  Others already knows what it means.  
* Wouldn't select the 3rd radio button as he doesn't have any benefits right now.  
* Could define STEM in parentheses in the question.  
* Expects the "Find your education benefits form" button will open up the next page.  

### OOS, Related to Wizard
* Knows the first radio button is for those who want to apply for a new benefit.  
* Know the second radio button is for those who are already in school.
