### Participant Info
* Applied for STEM Scholarship online in Dec and was accepted.
* Majoring in bio-chemistry
	
### Findings
* Knows that the Applying to extend" option allows you to apply for the STEM Scholarship (used it in December to apply).  
* Based on prior knowledge, knows that STEM Scholarship applicants have to 
	○ have close to no benefits left   
	○ be receiving a B.S. degree only  
	○ be studying in a stem field  
	○ be seeking an undergraduate degree, rather than an associates degree  
* Has the impression that a lot of people do not know what STEM is. Thinks mainly people in STEM fields know the acronym.  
* Accurately expects the Learn More link on VA Form 22-1995 will explain what the STEM Scholarship is and who is eligible.  

### Quotes
* "[The Learn More content] explains it really well. It has amount.  It has number of months."  
* "[The STEM Scholarship application] is really fast, very easy."  
* "I just want to say thank you for the scholarship.  It means a lot to my family because I was going to use a loan and now I don’t have to.  Thank you so much to whoever came up with this.  Thank you." 
	
### OOS, however related to Wizard
* When the "Find your education benefits form" button is clicked, expected different options to come up about benefits  (Of course, she'd already clicked it once).  
* Believes the "apply for a new benefit" option would allow you to apply for a new one.  
* Believes the Updating my current education benefits option allows you to "change the benefits you are already using."  

### OOS
* The electronic STEM Scholarship application process was very smooth.  
* Found out about the STEM Scholarship on a GI Bill Facebook page.  Followed it and applied when the scholarship became available.  
* Suggests having schools tell their Veteran students and posting information on Facebook.
