# STEM Scholarship - Wizard and STEM Application Review 

Dec 23, 2019 – Jan 17, 2020


#### Problem Statement 
As an individual seeking education benefits, I want to understand the eligibility criteria for the STEM scholarship so I can apply if I'm eligible and I don't waste my time applying if I'm not. If I’m currently not eligible, it'd be helpful to know if it's a scholarship I may be eligible for in the future.

#### Solution Hypothesis
By presenting more detailed information about STEM scholarship eligibility criteria in the Education Benefits routing wizard, and not directing individuals to the STEM application if they're not eligible, we will reduce the alarmingly high 90% rejection rate for the STEM Scholarship.

Furthermore, for individuals who bypass the wizard and access the STEM scholarship application directly, our future efforts will include more detail around STEM eligibility and other safeguards within the online application.  These efforts to enhance the online application will help applicants better understand the scholarship criteria and discourage those wh aren't eligible from applying unnecessarily.

#### Research Questions

The research is designed to answer the following questions:
 
* What do users know or what are their assumptions about STEM Scholarship eligibility criteria?
* Are users looking for information about STEM Scholarship eligibility before applying? If so, where? If no, why not?
* What do individuals seeking Education Benefits believe the nature of the STEM Scholarship to be as they complete the wizard?
* What additional information or contextual help within the wizard would ensure users understand the scope and criteria of the STEM scholarship and their potential eligibility?
* Why do individuals who are ineligible for the STEM Scholarship apply for it?
* What would deter individuals who are ineligible for the STEM Scholarship from applying for it?
* Would making modifications to the Wizard or to the application form itself have a larger impact in reducing applications from ineligible individuals? 

As time allows, we're also interested in gaining some insight into engagement with VA Form 22-1995 itself. For example: 
* What do individuals who access VA Form 22-1995 Request for Change of Program or Place of Training believe the nature of the STEM Scholarship to be?
*	What confusion do individuals experience when seeing the STEM questions on the Request for Change of Program or Place of Training application and how might this confusion be mitigated?


#### What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?

Developing an understanding of why individuals who aren't eligible for the STEM Scholarship continue to apply for it and identifying changes to the "How to apply" wizard that will discourage ineligible users from applying will make us feel like the research process has been successful.

#### What kinds of users do we need to talk to answer our questions?

The following users have been identified:
*	Veterans receiving education benefits, studying in STEM field, with >6 months of benefits
*	Veterans receiving education benefits, studying in non-STEM fields (languages, literature, philosophy, art, religion, law, business, politics, etc.), with any remaining benefits
* Veterans receiving education benefits who are considering changing schools, program of study, or training facility.


#### What specific questions do we need to ask on our Usability Testing screener to get the right kinds of users to test the form?

In addition to the standard questions, which ensure a representative mix of participants, the screener should include the following questions and responses:

1.	Have you applied for VA educational benefits before? [1/8 Next time, we'll recruit those who have applied for Post-9/11)
  * If yes, to Question 2
  * If no, end call.
2.	Would the idea of a scholarship that extended VA education benefits be appealing to you?
  * If yes, to Question 3
  * If no, end call.
3.	What is/was your field of study?
  * If STEM, to Question 4
  * If non-STEM, would you like to participate?
4.	How many months of your VA educational benefits remain?
  * If more than 6 months, would you like to participate?
  * If less than 6 months, end call. (Suggest they check out the STEM Scholarship application https://benefits.va.gov/gibill/fgib/stem.asp )

#### What testing and recording tools do we need to run the research sessions?

Remote Interviews will be recorded via WebEx Usability test sessions will be recorded via WebEx 

In-person notes will be taken by hand and/or on a computer.

#### What artifacts do we need to support the research effort?

The following artifacts will be developed:
