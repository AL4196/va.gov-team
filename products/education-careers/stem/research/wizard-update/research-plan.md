# STEM Scholarship - Wizard and STEM Application Review 

Dec 23, 2019 â€“ Jan 17, 2020


#### Problem Statement 
As an individual seeking education benefits, I am curious about all benefits I may be eligible for.  I want to understand the eligibility criteria for the STEM scholarhip so I can apply if I'm eligible and I don't waste my time applying if I'm not eligible.  Also, it'd be helpful to know if it's a scholarship I may be eligible for in the future.  

#### Solution Hypothesis
Presenting more detailed information about STEM scholarship eligibility criteria in the Education Benefits routing wizard, and not directing individuals to the STEM application if they're not eligible, we will reduce the alarmingly high rejection rate for the STEM Scholarship.  

Further, for individuals who are by-passing the wizard and accessing the STEM scholarship application directly, including more detail around STEM eligibility in the online application will help individuals better understand the scholarship criteria and discourage them for applying when they're not eligible. 

#### Research Questions

The research is designed to answer the following questions:
 
* What do individuals seeking Education Benefits believe the nature of the STEM Scholarship to be? 
* What do users know or what are their assumptions about STEM Scholarship eligibility criteria? 
* Why do individuals who are ineligible for the STEM Scholarship apply for it? 
* What would deter individuals who are ineligible for the STEM Scholarship from applying for it? 
* Are users looking for information about STEM Scholarship eligibility before applying? If so, where? If no, why not? 
* What additional information or contextual help would ensure users understand the scope and criteria of the STEM scholarship and their potential eligibility? 


#### What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?

Developing an understanding of why individuals who aren't eligible for the STEM Scholarship continue to apply for it will make us feel like the research process has been successful.

#### What kinds of users do we need to talk to answer our questions?

The following users have been identified:
*	Veterans receiving education benefits, studying in STEM field, with >6 months of benefits
* Veterans receiving education benefits, studying in non-STEM fields (languages, literature, philosophy, art, religion, law, business, politics, etc.), with any remaining benefits
*	Veterans receiving education benefits who are considering changing schools


#### What specific questions do we need to ask on our Usability Testing screener to get the right kinds of users to test the form?

In addition to the standard questions, which ensure a representative mix of participants, the screener should include the following questions and responses:

1.	Have you applied for VA educational benefits before? 
    * If yes, to Question 2
    * If no, end call.
2. Would the idea of a scholarship that extended VA education benefits be appealing to you? 
    * If yes, to Question 3
    * If no, end call.
3.	What is/was your field of study?
    * If STEM, to Question 4
    * If non-STEM, would you like to participate?
3. How many months of your VA educational benefits remain? 
    * If more than 6 months, would you like to participate?
    * If less than 6 months, end call. (Suggest they check out the STEM Scholarship application  https://benefits.va.gov/gibill/fgib/stem.asp )
