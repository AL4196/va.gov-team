# EDU stats for STEM wizard and form Oct 1, 2019 - Dec 20, 2019

 
 1. **STEM Rejections – Identify details on STEM scholarship rejections by type.<br>Counts /% of all EDU STEM applications, responses to each of the “2 of 6 education benefit” questions.**  
    * Applying for STEM Scholarship  
    * Enrolled in a STEM undergrad program  
    * Have a STEM undergrad degree & pursuing a teaching certification  

    **EDU Response:** So it appears that the only way to view the answers to the questions would be to go into each individual applicant’s record in TIMS and transcribe that data into a spreadsheet or database.  Currently the application responses are captured into TIMS, but you cannot export or view all the applications…<br>
    
    Ricardo seemed to think that response data would be available through Google Analytics.  I [Luke] said I don’t think that is captured.

    **EDU Recommendation:** We have received 10358 applications.  I do not recommend that we go the manual look up and transcribe route.  I recommend we try to have a way to capture this data going forward with the changes we are going to make. 
  
 3. High level data as of 12/19/19:

    * So about 30% are denied b/c they are not in an eligible program and another 30% because they have not exhausted their benefit.  

4. File shared by Buffalo is below.  This is what they capture there in Buffalo.

5. **How many people are coming through the Wizard vs. direct traffic to the form?**   

   Since OCT 1, 2019 to DEC 17, 2019:
    * 25,000 people coming through the Wizard (since Oct 1, 2019)
    * 1995 40,000 regular applicants
    * 1995 / STEM – 4,000
    * **122,750 direct traffic to the apply 1995 page**

6. **Similar Scholarships - Identify VA scholarships “similar” to STEM – with acceptance / rejection rates. Ricardo may have this info.**  

    **EDU Response:** I have not found, and no one here is aware, of any scholarship program that is similar to the STEM program.  Most of the scholarships I have found have a limit to the number of students.  So it may be tough to get at who was denied for ineligibility, vs. who was denied because they ran out of spaces. <br>
    
    For Federal Student aid I found that in FY2016 they processed 19.2 million applications and there were 13.2 million recipients (about a 70% approval rate).
