# EDU stats for STEM wizard and form Oct 1, 2019 - Dec 20, 2019


1. EDU reports **STEM FORM has 90% Rejection Rate**. <br>

   **Ideal goal is 0% Rejection Rate**. Need to understand reasons for & numbers behind rejections to clearly identify rejection rate goals going forward.  
   
      Reasons for rejection:
    * Not enrolled in a STEM program
    * Not near the benefits exhaustion (6 months or less). *SIDE NOTE: We should know that they don’t have the benefit.*

 2. **STEM Rejections – Identify details on STEM scholarship rejections by type.<br>Counts /% of all EDU STEM applications, responses to each of the “2 of 6 education benefit” questions.**  
    * Applying for STEM Scholarship  
    * Enrolled in a STEM undergrad program  
    * Have a STEM undergrad degree & pursuing a teaching certification  

    **EDU Response:** So it appears that the only way to view the answers to the questions would be to go into each individual applicant’s record in TIMS and transcribe that data into a spreadsheet or database.  Currently the application responses are captured into TIMS, but you cannot export or view all the applications…<br>
    
    Ricardo seemed to think that response data would be available through Google Analytics.  I [Luke] said I don’t think that is captured.

    **EDU Recommendation:** We have received 10358 applications.  I do not recommend that we go the manual look up and transcribe route.  I recommend we try to have a way to capture this data going forward with the changes we are going to make. 
  
 3. High level data as of 12/19/19:

    * So about 30% are denied b/c they are not in an eligible program and another 30% because they have not exhausted their benefit.  
    
    * **Is there more detail about the remaining ~2800 and why they were denied [in the above graphic]?**  
    
      **EDU Response:** Probably but they may not be tracking it in the detail we would like. For example we know that some of those are because they are applying for a program that is not eligible.  But we don’t go the next step to be able to show which programs are folks applying for that are not eligible.  We just know that x number of people applied and put down a program that is not on the approved STEM list. 

4. File shared by Buffalo is below.  This is what they capture in Buffalo.

5. **How many people are coming through the Wizard vs. direct traffic to the form?**   

   Since OCT 1, 2019 to DEC 17, 2019:
    * 25,000 people coming through the Wizard (since Oct 1, 2019)
    * 1995 40,000 regular applicants
    * 1995 / STEM – 4,000
    * **122,750 direct traffic to the apply 1995 page**

6. **Similar Scholarships - Identify VA scholarships “similar” to STEM – with acceptance / rejection rates. Ricardo may have this info.**  

    **EDU Response:** I have not found, and no one here is aware, of any scholarship program that is similar to the STEM program.  Most of the scholarships I have found have a limit to the number of students.  So it may be tough to get at who was denied for ineligibility, vs. who was denied because they ran out of spaces. <br>
    
    For Federal Student aid I found that in FY2016 they processed 19.2 million applications and there were 13.2 million recipients (about a 70% approval rate).
