# EDU Analytics stats for STEM wizard and form Oct 1, 2019 - Dec 20, 2019

 
 1. **STEM Rejections – Identify details on STEM scholarship rejections by type.<br>Counts /% of all EDU STEM applications, responses to each of the “2 of 6 education benefit” questions.**  
    * Applying for STEM Scholarship  
    * Enrolled in a STEM undergrad program  
    * Have a STEM undergrad degree & pursuing a teaching certification  

    **EDU Response:** So it appears that the only way to view the answers to the questions would be to go into each individual applicant’s record in TIMS and transcribe that data into a spreadsheet or database.  Currently the application responses are captured into TIMS, but you cannot export or view all the applications…<br>Ricardo seemed to think that response data would be available through Google Analytics.  I [Luke] said I don’t think that is captured.

    **EDU Recommendation:** We have received 10358 applications.  I do not recommend that we go the manual look up and transcribe route.  I recommend we try to have a way to capture this data going forward with the changes we are going to make. 
  
 3. High level data as of 12/19/19:

    * So about 30% are denied b/c they are not in an eligible program and another 30% because they have not exhausted their benefit.
