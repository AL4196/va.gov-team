## Lessons learned and considerations from Global Entry
- Global Entry Application was too long: 4 pages with 10 things to do per page. Users got fatigued and weren't finishing the application. The PreCheck application was much shorter. 
- Users were not clear on whether they needed PreCheck, Global Entry, or one of the other potential systems. They had to do a lot of work about letting people know what their options were. Perhaps we could have some sort of wizard/content that would help people figure out if they need a Veteran ID Card, or if they have other options. 

## DOD considerations
1. When service members retire or separate, they get one last order generated from HR, incl. where their home of record is, where they are allowed to move to. It has their discharge status. That is a document that everyone should have and could upload. DOD is currently working on building APIs with each of the branches of service to pull that document. Is that something we could possibly have a Veteran upload? Or have them upload their DD214? 

2. DEERS would almost certainly have an image of the Veteran in database from their ID cards while in the military. If we needed to go down the route of the photo, could we tap into that database as a way of verifying that the person is who they say they are? 

3. Veterans who are retiring are required to go to any base by their home and get an ID card. This has DD214 number, photograph, blood type, status, etc. on it. It may be worth going to the Pentagon to talk to the TAC/ID office to see what is required for that card. Might Veterans still have it if it has been many years post separation or retirement? Would there be a database that VA could tap into to either pull that photograph or use it to verify?
