What has been communicated to you so far?
- By integrating w/SF there's  potential to allow for digital cards int he future in case there's failure to print
- Want to expose better FE experience and maintain more control over back-end
- 2 projects simultaneous: maintain current implementation, and work on V2
- Requirements are loose: new FE, and get whatever supporting API in place for FE
- Need documentation on SF API (Alex YL is discussing w/SF currently, James will try and get more info, but maybe can start to be owned by Raindbows project tech lead)
- Still need Veteran Status and other info (comes from us, MVI and eMIS), and not sure if there are others for the VA BE system (SSOI, but that would happen within SF)
- Only net new connection should be SF
- Plan for eventuality that SF integration won't happen as quickly as the rest, and we may need to store data for some amount of time
- Unknown: does SF do validation on our data?
- Also unknown: tech details around image validation (image kit facial recognition system?). Patrick has seen code around normalizing uploaded image to resolution to render preview card.
- Unsure how image validation happens (btwn DL and photo image for the card)
- Requirement: be able to see your card and your status
- Requirement for future roadmap: could pull up image of the card on your phone to use digitally
- End state now: users believe VA will mail them a physical card within 60 days
- Unknown: whether email confirmation, or confirmation number is available/sent
- Requirement: email based beta registration mechanism (not a current requirement, but we may want it to slow down traffic etc)
- Requirement: user must be authenticated w/Vets.gov account (LOA3 - since we can only look up stuff from eMIS/MVI for LOA3 but valid requirement to get card also)
- No UX or design convos yet
- Requirement: launch by mid January 2018

Problem Statement
Veterans want access to discounts that they deserve, but don't want to carry their DD214 or other sensitive PII around with them to prove their status. They need something else that proves their Veteran status, w/o exposing other sensitive info about them.

Goals
- As a user, I want to successfully submit application for an ID card, and have transparency into the status of my application.
- As VA, I want to capture Veteran information necessary to deliver ID card to the user in the future.

SUPER rough roadmap
Research - recruiting through Research team, sessions led by Lauren
Solution Strategy (per user research, and goals above) - 2 meetings w/Lauren, Leanna, whole team to define flow
Technical Discovery - SF API, VA BE, Photo upload/editing
Designs - Lauren and Stacy
Documentation of possible error states and unhappy paths -
Content/messaging - Peggy, Amy B, Lauren
Implementation - FE, BE builds (heads up, lots of ppl out for vacation)
Testing - Platform will be set up to do this as APIs are solidified (will start building load testing harnesses as APIs are ready, to simulate peak load from Dec 1 as a starting point). Want to also do integration testing w/SF endpoint, and that'll determine synch or batch processing.
UAT - live behind PW w/10 users
Launch!

Risks
- Research time
- No print mechanism
- VA BE

Who's involved in the effort
Hello

What work will get delayed
Hello

Next steps:
- Strategy sync (including ppl w/bg), solution design, and update to Kerry and Charles
- Find out right stakeholders to confirm requirements etc
- Write GH issues for the work
- Schedule research, and initial strategy meetings
