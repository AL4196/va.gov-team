## Section 0: Warm-Up Questions

- What branch of the military did you serve in? 

  * Army.

- When did you retire or separate? 

  * July 31, 2016.

- Are you aware of any forms of veteran identification, such as something that might show proof of service, discharge status, or Veteran benefits? 

  - If YES: Which ones? 
  - Any others? 
  - (Prompt if needed: Are you aware of Veteran Health ID Cards, Veteran designation on State ID cards or licenses, etc.) 
  - Do you have any of these forms of identification? 
  - Do you know anyone who does? 
   
## Section 1: Value of VIC (Not User Voice)

- Have you heard anything about Veteran's ID Cards issued by the VA? 
  - (If YES: What have you heard?) 
  
    * Yes. I have heard of the VA Identification card.
    * (anything else) No... the DD214. That's basically been it. I've been asked to supply the DD214 for a lot of the services I've been asked to apply for.
    * I've had a VA ID... some time in October or November of 2016. SSinceunce then, I have lost that identification card. I've tried to get a replacement ID card twice. Still have not gotten a replacement.
    * I went to the VA after my first appointment with them to check out my prescriptions and the only ID I had was my blue military ID. I went to the VA and took a picture and was given a VA card 2 weeks later in the mail, but since I lost it I have not been able to replace it. (sounds like he is talking about the VA healthcare ID card)
 
  
- If needed: The demand for the Veteran ID card was much higher than the VA anticipated, and we learned from reviewing all of the website feedback that the application process was frustrating. I am working with the team that was brought in to help fix both of those things, and your feedback and answers to my questions will be really helpful. 

- Can you tell me what the requirements are to get a Veteran's ID card? 

    * Requirements — they looked in their system and I was already in their system at that point because I was already almost medically retired.
    * First thing I would have to show is some type of ID showing myself and possible the 214. Those are the only things that should be neessary to prove you are who you are and you are a veteran.


- Have you ever tried to apply for a Veteran's ID Card from the VA? 
  - If YES: When? 
  - Which website did you go to to apply?
  - Were you able to complete the application? (If NO: Can you tell me what happened when you tried?)    
  
    * (Told story about getting a replacement healthcare card) That was at the administration section of the VA in Fayetteville, NC. I went back there when I lost it and I've yet to receive it. It's been 3 months. It's OK because I have my blue retiree card, but I like the VA card because I don't go on post. I'd rather have that just for safety reasons.
    * Veteran ID on driver licenses — To be honest with you, the veteran one would be better. One, it's a national identification card. I know state ID cards might be ok, but if we go to a national system, that card is good everywhere. I'd rather have someone look at that card, be familiar with that card... do you know how many times I've been asked if that's fake? Anytime I show my blue ID card it goes off without a hithc. When you go to another state with another state ID, that doesn't do as much as a federal ID.

- Do you think there are advantages that a VA Veteran ID Card offers that other forms of military or veteran ID do not provide? 
  - If YES: What are the advantages? 
  - (Clarification question if needed: Do you think that the VA Veteran ID Card offers benefits that other Veteran ID cards do not provide? If Yes, what are those benefits?)  
  - (If needed: If you found out that another form of Veteran ID, such as a driver's license with a Veteran marking), gave you the same benefits as a VA-issued Veteran's ID card, would you still be interested in a VA issued Veteran ID card?) 

    * Benefits — First off is definitely going to be the discounts. Let's be honest here, the first time anyone says anything about the veteran's ID card it's right there for the discount. That's going to be the first and probably the primary reason. Secondary is a second ID card. A lot of places are asking for a second ID.... social security, DMV, where you need to be in accordance with the TrueID laws. Using that as a secondary ID may alleviate the TrueID... it would be easier than finding a birth certificate or social security card. 

- In what ways would having a Veterans ID Card issued by the VA help you personally? (Why did you want one?)  

## Section 2: Logging in
- Can you talk about any other times when you have applied for or renewed a government-issued photo ID, such as a driver's license or a passport? How did you do this? What steps did you take? 
  - Have you ever done this online? 
  - (If YES: Did you have to login to a website to apply?)
  
    * Applied for any other federal ID — I've had a passport, but I lost that a long time ago and it's probably expired. Besides that, that's the only thing I've ever done. 
    * Going to get a government ID — The last one that I got for a government ID card was my blue ID card. (process) It's actually a ... this is a story, I hate to say this. My son, he was in college at that time. He had lost his ID card. It had expired. I tried to go down to the Fort Bragg ID card center to get him a new one and I ran into such bad experience and ended up doing and ICE complaint against them.... (something about going onto a website) I went on there and scheduled an appointment and the person in charge helped me out that day and I had to sho two forms of ID for my children and myself.

- In the current version, Veterans need to login using DS Logon or ID.me to access the application. 
  - Do you think you should need to login to a website to apply for a Veteran ID Card? 
  - Do you have any concerns about applying for a VIC on a public-facing website, where you do not have to login?

- What would you want to know about the application process before you started? What information would be most useful to you? 

- Do you have a DS Logon Premium, My HealtheVet Premium, or an ID.me account? 

  - If NO: Would you be willing to register for a new web account in order to apply for a VIC, if you knew it would take 10 minutes to do so, and that you would need to verify your identity by uploading a copy of your license or passport?  
  
    * (Does have a DS Logon)
    * If an ID card facility is not available, then yes, it would be a lot more convenient. Especially for those living in rural areas who need a travel voucher to get to the VA.
    * (would you want to be logged in?) Logged in. (why?) It's as simple as fraud.
    * I would like to know what proof of ID would be necessary, how long the process would take, if there are additional forms that need to be uploaded or if there is something that needs to be done prior to... that's what I would need.

- Would you be willing to upload a copy of your DD214 as part of the application? 

   * Yeah, for me I already have it on every computer because I've been asked to upload it for gosh knows how long.

- The VA must obtain proof of identity, proof of military history, and proof of honorable discharge status in order to provide a Veteran ID card. 
  - If you learned that the VA could verify your eligibility for a VIC faster during the application process if you logged in before submitting the application, would that be of interest to you? 
  - If you learned that you could track the status of your VIC application online if you logged in before submitting the application, would that be of interest to you?  
  - If the VA had incorrect information about you in its database that would affect your eligibility for a Veteran ID Card, how could we be most helpful to you in notifying you of that error and helping you correct it? 

- At what benchmarks in the VIC application process would you want to receive notifications from the VA? (Application submitted, Application received + ID #, Eligibility Verified, Printed Card Sent...other?)

  * (would you want to know you could track status?) Yes
  * (what if VA had incorrect info about you) Are we talking about if I have to update my address? (eg. files got crossed and couldn't find that you were honorably discharged). Then there should be a call number to somewhere to get that taken care of. I know that the Army does their own thing in St Louis for retirees... this should not be something that the VA should have. It should go from agency to agency.
  * (Notifications?) Application submitted, application approved, ID made, ID shipped, verification of receipt of ID card.

- How long do you expect the application process will take from the time you start until you hit submit? 
 
   * (how long should it take) I think about 10 – 15 minutes should be OK. I work fast on computer so I'm a little biased on that as opposed to older veterans who have no idea what they are doing.
 
- How long would you expect it to take between finding out that your VIC application was approved and receiving your Veteran ID Card? 
 
 * (how longs should ID processing take) In all honesty, about two to three weeks, my current experience not withstanding.

- If a Veteran Service Organization or your local VA office could help you complete your Veteran ID card application if you visited them in person, how interested would you be in that option? Use a scale from 1-5, where 1 is not very interested and 5 is very interested. 

* (if VA could help you in person) I wouldn't be interested in that option but I know people that would. I can do all my stuff online and have no problem with it. I know some people would rather go to VA and have a live person help the out. For me, I wouldn't do it but I know others that would.
* (why online?) Convenience

## Section 3: Appearance of Card 
- On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is the least important and 5 is very important, how important is it to you that your Veteran ID Card  indicates which branch or branches of the Armed Services you served in? 

* I'm gonna give that about a 3 because of branch superiority. To be honest with you, I wouldn't even look at it, but I'd do it for bragging rights. If it says my pay grade and retired, that's fine with me. If it said my rank, that would be nice. I'd have proof of the branch I was in for bragging rights.

- On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is the least important and 5 is very important, how important is it to you that your Veteran ID Card  features a photo of you? 

* 5. It's an ID card, that's why? Whats the point if you can't prove that's you?

- Have you ever uploaded a print document or photo to a website? 
  - Can you tell me more about that experience? 
  - Using a scale from 1-5 where 1 is very difficult and 5 is very easy, how hard was it for you to do so?
  - (If they don't specify how they digitized the document): How did you make the print document or photo digital? 
  - (If they mention any assistive technology, follow up:) Can you tell me more about how you use that device you mentioned? 

* Very. It's easy for me.

- If you had to submit an official passport photo for the VIC application, how easy or difficult would it be for you to get one taken? Use a scale from 1-5 where 1 is very difficult and 5 is very easy.

* For me it won't be that difficult because... I would say it would be tiresome. In order to upload a picture, and this is a part that I'm about to get very convoluted on, but you're telling me I need to go to a third party, get the pciture take, wait fo rit to be ready, scan it, and upload it. I'd rather use a VA database where our pictures already are on. That's how I would do it. I wouldn't want anyone to go out, do work, stop what they were doing, to go get an ID picture and wait for that to complete the process because by that time, everyone's going to forget what they were doing.

- If you could take your own photo but it still had to meet passport photo standards, how confident do you feel that you could do that? Use a scale from 1-5 where 1 is not very confident and 5 is very confident.

* I could do that on my own but I wouldn't want to do that. Part of that is because of standardization. If this a gov't ID card, there should be standardization, not something people can use their own standard for. It says you can have a plain background... but I'd feel more confident if someone who was qualified did it for us.

- What do you think a Veteran ID Card will look like?

* I think it should look something like the Veteran's medical card. It should have the VA emblem, the name, address of the service member, dischard status... whatever their status was at the end of their active duty or reserve timeframe. (may have also said rank).

## Section 4: Digital vs Print

- We're exploring doing a digital card that you'd be able to pull up on your phone (and in theory could get access to much more quickly than a plastic card).
  - Have you ever heard about or used a digital ID card?
  - Would you be interested in a digital VIC? Do you have any concerns about that?
  - Would you still want a plastic card?

* Does ID.me constitute a digital ID card? I used it during the last VA interview I did about healthcare and refilling my medication. I've done the ID.me thing, but as far as a digital ID card on a device... no. (you wouldn't use it because of fraud?) Yeah.
* (What if you needed a fingerprint?) It would, but for the older generations... (talked about smart phones and how older people may not be able to access it this way). For me, I'm old school. I'd rather have it physically in my hand.

## Closing Interview - 5 minutes

- Do you have any comments or questions about the Veteran ID Card that we have not yet covered today?  

* Is it ready? I'd sure want one.
* I think, just on a cost saving measure, that Veteran ID card should be the sole-purpose card for anyone coming out of the military. It should be just like your military card. You should trade one for the other. It should have the same validity. You shouldn't have to have a medical card and a veteran ID. One card. It should be the one everyone has. It's standardized. It's recognized. That's it.
* I would strongly suggest against modeling it like a CAC where it has the chip inside and you need a special reader. You've got way too many older gentlemen that would not even care about the chip inside of their ID. To get a card reader attached to a computer so you'd have to use it instead of a DS Login... I'm not doing it. The standard scanning on the back of ID is something I think should still be done. It should have bar codes that allow readers to process your ID. 
* For the security and all that... the holograms and whatever the TSA agents see under blue lights... whatever to make it more secure.
