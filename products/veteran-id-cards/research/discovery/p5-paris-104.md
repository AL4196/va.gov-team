March 24, 2017
- *Are you aware of any forms of veteran identification, such as something that might show proof of service, discharge status, or Veteran benefits?* 
The only thing I am aware of is the DD214 and I had heard a few months ago about the VIC but so far I haven't been able to get it. But only those two, so far.
  - *If YES: Which ones?* 
  - *Any others?* 
  - *Are you aware of Veteran Health ID Cards, Veteran designation on State ID cards or licenses, etc.)*

## Section 1: Value of VIC (User Voice) 
- *Tell me about your experience trying to apply for a Veteran ID Card* 
  - *What website did you go to to start?* 
  - *Were you able to complete the application process? (If NO: At what point in the application did you get stuck?)* 
  - *Was there anything that you found confusing about the application instructions?* 
  - *What else do you want me to know about your experience?*  
It wasn't the worst experience. it's was just kind of, it wasnt working. It's been a while I havent tried it in a ltitle bit. Basically, i was able to get 95% of the way through and then either the website or my computer basically wouldn't be able to verify my identity. That's about it so far. 
  I've used the ID software that vets.gov wanted me to use. ID.me seems to work so far, once I got passed the whole verifying my identity I would apply, follow the prompts to apply for the Veterans ID Card just as I was getting the to last step I would not be able to verify or something, and that's as far as I got.
  I went to either Vets.gov or eBenefits.gov I can't remember which one basically I've tried multiple, trying to get to it, trying to get to the ID card... I would try to sign in and then it would send me a six digit pass code on my phone I would enter that code and after that I would be in. I haven't had any trouble so far with ID.me.
  I believe it was an error message but let's see I should have written down exactly what it was. Ummmm I don't remember at the moment I just remember it was at the bottom of the screen about verifying my identity or proof of service.
  Nothing terribly confusing about the instructions. Like I said, it was pretty easy until I got to the point where it could no longer identify me. 
  Nothing terribly memorable, really this is just the one experience I have had with the VA websites. If there was something that could be changed, I would try to make it fewer websites. Is VA only vets.gov or do they also run eBenefits? That would be the one thing I could change if I could try to make it fewer websites.
  It hasn't been so honestly don't remember did I give feedback before this? That was probably when I was upset.
  The whole thing hasn't been horrible bad situation, but I understand there are like 600 VA websites and some times people are going to have trouble. I was the lucky one to have trouble the week that I tried.
- *So, when you came to the website to apply, can you tell me why you were interested in having a Veteran's ID card?* 
Yes I would like to not have to carry around a DD214 I don't really carry it around. I'm sure there's a va card for disabled vets but I'm not disabled so I would be nice to have something strudier laminated in my wallet. Possibly a number that could be entered in a website. Mostly for the discounts. 

  - *How would having a VIC help you?*
This would be the only veteran id that I have other than the DD214 which I'm not excited to carry around, but mostly if I need proof of service, there it is in my wallet.
- *Do you think there are advantages that a VA Veteran ID Card offers that other forms of military or veteran ID do not provide?* 
  - *If YES: What are the advantages?* 
  - *Do you think that the VA Veteran ID Card offers benefits that other Veteran ID cards do not provide? If Yes, what are those benefits?*    
  - *If you found out that another form of Veteran ID, such as a driver's license with a Veteran marking), gave you the same benefits as a VA-issued Veteran's ID card, would you still be interested in a VA issued Veteran ID card?* 
I would. Only because I wouldn't know if the VA id card would be more benefitical or helpful if I had to go to a VA hospital or something.I don't think I would lose interest in getting it from the VA. 
- *Can you tell me what the requirements are to get a Veteran's ID card?* 
I would guess that you need I dont know...information from the DD214 or ssn or mmm I don't know. I would say anything found on the DD214 I don't know how the VA would verify that. 

GOVERNMENT OR DRIVERS OR PASEPORT
Renewal the steps involved seem to be going to the DMV and pay them $50. I'm sure you can do it online, I actually had to renew mine, actually give my parents power of attorney to renew my id while I was overseas. I would be willing to guess that you could renew online. If that was the only way to apply I would probably recommend a few more options, such as mail or...if you're one of the lucky few who lives near a location then just walk into the VA. But physical location, regular mail or websites would all be helpful.
## Section 2: Logging in
- *Can you talk about any other times when you have applied for or renewed a government-issued photo ID, such as a driver's license or a passport? How did you do this? What steps did you* take? 
  - *Have you ever done this online?* 
  - *Did you have to login to a website to apply?*
*does login in bother you?*
I don't mind logging in or having to sign in. Perfectly happy to prove who I am online to get any service I need from the VA.
- *In the current version, Veterans need to login using DS Logon or ID.me to access the application.* 
  - *Do you think you should need to login to a website to apply for a Veteran ID Card?* 
  - *Do you have any concerns about applying for a VIC on a public-facing website, where you do not have to login?*
Yes I think if you didn't have to log in... although I don't know. If there was some sort of verification- don't ask me the questions, if the VA asked the VA...if I did the time. If the VA was to verify who I am with themselves.. I would still rather prove who I am.
- *What would you want to know about the application process before you started? What information would be most useful to you?* 
2:16pm CHECK almost I don;t know what else would be helpful.
- *Do you have a DS Logon Premium, My HealtheVet Premium, or an ID.me account?* 
  - *If NO: Would you be willing to register for a new web account in order to apply for a VIC, if you knew it would take 10 minutes to do so, and that you would need to verify your identity by uploading a copy of your license or passport?*  

- *Would you be willing to upload a copy of your DD214 as part of the application?* 

- *The VA must obtain proof of identity, proof of military history, and proof of honorable discharge status in order to provide a Veteran ID card.* 
  - *If you learned that the VA could verify your eligibility for a VIC faster during the application process if you logged in before submitting the application, would that be of interest to you?* 
  I would be more likely to want to use that, definitely.
  - *If you learned that you could track the status of your VIC application online if you logged in before submitting the application, would that be of interest to you?*  
  Yes if it told me that it wasn't ... kind of like the IRS website where it will tell you what step you're on out of how many steps. I don't think... 
  An email with here is why and here is who specifically I can contact. Not just the VA's main number. 
  - *If the VA had incorrect information about you in its database that would affect your eligibility for a Veteran ID Card, how could we be most helpful to you in notifying you of that error and helping you correct it?* 

- *At what benchmarks in the VIC application process would you want to receive notifications from the VA? (Application submitted, Application received + ID #, Eligibility Verified, Printed Card Sent...other?)*

- *How long do you expect the application process will take from the time you start until you hit submit?* 
The very first time I expected it would take 30 minutes to an hour. 
- *How long would you expect it to take between finding out that your VIC application was approved and receiving your Veteran ID Card?*
Realistically? Probably...Over a year, between 6 months and a year and half. Yes...Not terribly high expectations.
- *If a Veteran Service Organization or your local VA office could help you complete your Veteran ID card application if you visited them in person, how interested would you be in that option? Use a scale from 1-5, where 1 is not very interested and 5 is very insterested.* 
That would be my second option, basically, short of going online. I would rather go into an office rather than send a letter. I think it would be convenient. 
## Section 3: Appearance of Card 
- *On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is the least important and 5 is very important, how important is it to you that your Veteran ID Card  indicates which branch or branches of the Armed Services you served in?* 
I'd give it a 3 (Navy) - it's not as important, but it would still be cool. I would still appreciate it if it said Navy as opposed to Armed Services.
- *On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is the least important and 5 is very important, how important is it to you that your Veteran ID Card  features a photo of you?* 
4...4.5...  if I was to use it in a place, I think it would be important so I wouldn't have to bring a second form of ID. I could just shpw the picture. That's me in the picture. The same reason we like photo IDs at all. Let's just bump that up to 5 it would be very important to me. 
- *Have you ever uploaded a print document or photo to a website?* 
That would be pretty easy. I do not have a digital copy of my dd214 only a physical copy. I would either use a like a photocopier scanner or a scan snap brand scanner. Another option to uh to select that file and drag and drop. Drag and drop basically into a drop down box. Once it's in there, an actual what do you call it a preview, so you're absolutely sure its the DD214 file and that goes the same for the picture, maybe even the ability to crop the picture.
  - *Can you tell me more about that experience?* 
  - *Using a scale from 1-5 where 1 is very difficult and 5 is very easy, how hard was it for you to do so?*
  
  - *How did you make the print document or photo digital?* I would imagine there would be an option somewhere on the website that said upload a photo... I would click on that and then it would give me an option of taking a photo here with my webcam or uploading a photo from a file. Open the file and import it and click enter.
  - *Can you tell me more about how you use that assistive device you mentioned?* 

- *If you had to submit an official passport photo for the VIC application, how easy or difficult would it be for you to get one taken? Use a scale from 1-5 where 1 is very difficult and 5 is very easy.*
Pretty difficult for one thing I don't have a passeport. oh..I would give it as 5 as long as it's spelled out.
- *If you could take your own photo but it still had to meet passport photo standards, how confident do you feel that you could do that? Use a scale from 1-5 where 1 is not very confident and 5 is very confident.*
3
## Section 4: Digital vs Print

- *What do you think a Veteran ID Card will look like?*
I imagine it will be a white card with a small black and white photo on the back of the card and the words VETERANS ID CARD on the front maybe some kind of number, not sure what it would be related to. Maybe a designation of branch and the branch;s seal. Fuzzy picture. That's about it.
- *We're exploring doing a digital card that you'd be able to pull up on your phone (and in theory could get access to much more quickly than a plastic card).*
  - *Have you ever heard about or used a digital ID card?* I would say that's pretty cool. I would probably use that too. 
  - *Would you be interested in a digital VIC? Do you have any concerns about that?* yes 
  - *Would you still want a plastic card?* I would definitely want to have a plastic card. Well both. If my wallet's stolen right before I'm about to get a discount or the VA. It would be beneficial just because having two options rather than one is always good. 

## Closing Interview

- *Do you have any comments or questions about the Veteran ID Card that we have not yet covered today?*  
I would be happy with an email or a text message even if they wanted togo that far. Even snail mail, but as a last resort. Do it like amazon does it, when it's in route and when it's done and been delivered.

Definitely Amazon gift card.
