# Veteran Card Preferences
 Quotations from Research 

**What should the card look like?** 
- "For the security and all that... the holograms and whatever the TSA agents see under blue lights... whatever to make it more secure." - Round 1

- ""I would strongly suggest against modeling it like a CAC where it has the chip inside and you need a special reader. You've got way too many older gentlemen that would not even care about the chip inside of their ID. To get a card reader attached to a computer so you'd have to use it instead of a DS Login... I'm not doing it. The standard scanning on the back of ID is something I think should still be done. It should have bar codes that allow readers to process your ID." - Round 1

- "I think it should look something like the Veteran's medical card. It should have the VA emblem, the name, address of the service member, discharge status... whatever their status was at the end of their active duty or reserve timeframe." - Round 1

- "I imagine it will be a white card with a small black and white photo on the back of the card and the words VETERANS ID CARD on the front maybe some kind of number, not sure what it would be related to. Maybe a designation of branch and the branch's seal. Fuzzy picture. That's about it."- Round 1

- "Very similar to a driver's license. A white background. It's gonna say Veterans' ID Card across it. Date of birth, probably a Veterans' ID number that's hopefully not just my SSN. Photo ID. May have some holographic securities on it which would be nice being that it's an ID card." - Round 1

- "[Branch of service] It's not necessary, but I would like it."

- "Think it will look so fantastic that you'll want to show all your friends and family!"

- "It becomes more personal. When people see the picture, they know it's you. It's just more of a personal thing."

- [Branch of service] "More importantly, I'm proud to have served as a "veteran". Secondarily, yeah, I have pride in the Army and the things I did in the Army."

- "Something in big letters: veteran ID. After that, service, picture, served honorably in the US military. Whatever you guys want to do to make it cool."

- "I have no idea. They had a little photo at the bottom of what it was going to look like, but I don't know what it's going to look like in the end. I thought that it was just a demo card."

- ""No fake looking cards. People can wave a card, but it's official government identification."

- "To be honest with you, the veteran [ID card] would be better [than a veteran-designation on a driver's license]. One, it's a national identification card. I know state ID cards might be ok, but if we go to a national system, that card is good everywhere. I'd rather have someone look at that card, be familiar with that card... do you know how many times I've been asked if that's fake? Anytime I show my blue ID card it goes off without a hitch. When you go to another state with another state ID, that doesn't do as much as a federal ID."

- ""Would probably still want the VA one. It's associated with the VA. If I had an issue with the VA, it's already approved by the VA. Don't want to go through some rigmarole with the VA not honoring a state's veteran status on their state ID."

- "Some people say okay and accept [my driver's license], but most I have to argue and they say they need a certain card and point to the card." 

- "One thing I will let you know they do take about these state ID with veterans' designation. I have noticed that a lot of the places like restaurants etc they don’t like a veterans designation on a license. They don’t seem to trust it. They were just like… luckily they had a copy of their DD214. I don’t know they don’t think much of ti on your drivers’ license. If Colorado has one I didn’t even bother."

**Quotations from Comments**

- "WTF does "Choose VA", mean and why does it take up a larger share of the photo? All the card needs is a legible legit govt logo, a photo, a name, and "this is a Veteran" line. Instead it's mostly white space with a tiny photo, an illegible VA seal, a mystery "Choose VA" logo, and fine print. FAIL." - David Lewis [https://taskandpurpose.com/veteran-id-card-application-works/](https://taskandpurpose.com/veteran-id-card-application-works/)
