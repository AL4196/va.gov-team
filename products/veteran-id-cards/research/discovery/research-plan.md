# How Might We? 
**How might we make the process of applying for a Veteran ID Card (VIC) seamless and pain-free for Veterans, regardless of eligiblity?** 

# Goals of Discovery Research
Through this discovery research, we want to be able to answer the following questions: 
1. **What do Veterans perceive as the value of a VIC?**

#### Related questions 
(Note, some of these overlap: Feedback welcome on picking or revising. )
- Have you heard anything about Veteran ID Cards? (If so, what?)
- What other forms of Veteran identification do you know of? 
- What are the benefits of having a Veteran ID card? 
- How do you think / would a VIC help you? 
- On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is "not very important"  and 5 is "Very important", how important is it to you to have a VIC? 

2. **Do Veterans consider logging in an undesirable barrier to get a VIC? Are there any situations in which Veterans feel that the *pros* (prefill; potential on-the-spot eligibility checking; tying to profile) of logging in outweigh the *cons* (if no ID.me account, need to ID proof before they can apply - 2 separate processes)?** 

#### Related questions
- Can you talk about any other times when you have applied for a government-issued ID? Have you ever done this online? Did you have to login to a website to do so? 
- Would you expect to login to a website to apply for a VIC? 
- Would you have any concerns about applying for a VIC on a public-facing website, where you do not have to login? 
- If you had to register for an account and prove your identity in order to apply for a VIC, would that make you much more likely to want one, much less likely to want one, or no effect? 
- If we could check your eligibility for a VIC during the application process if you logged in, would that make you much more likely to login, much less likely to login, or no change? 
- If you could track the status of your application on Vets.gov, would that make you more likely to login to the VIC application, less likely to login to the VIC application, or no effect?

3. **A Veteran needs to provide a photograph (potentially a government-issued photograph) to get a VIC. What tools or instructions do we need to make available to Veterans to help them with this?** 
#### Related questions
- Do you have access to a camera? A camera on a phone, tablet, or computer is ok. 
- Do you have access to a scanner? An application on a phone is ok. 
- Have you ever uploaded a photo of yourself to a website? Can you tell me more about that experience? Was it hard for you to do? 
- If I asked you to take a high-resolution headshot of yourself with a plain white background behind you (like a passport photo), and upload that to a website, can you talk me through how you might do that?  
- On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is the least confident and 5 is the most confident, how confident do you feel that you could take and upload a photo of yourself? 
- On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is the least confident, and 5 is the most confident, how confident do you feel that you could scan and upload a copy of your driver's license, passport, or other government-issued identification card? 
- Do you use any assistive devices when accessing the internet that might make it hard to take or upload a photo of yourself? 

4. **Do Veterans want to identify their branch of service on the ID card? If they have served in multiple branches, would they want to pick one or a general option?** 

#### Related questions
- On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is the least important and 5 is very important, how important is it to you that your Veteran ID Card would indicate which branch or branches of the Armed Services you served in? 

5. **A Veteran must be eligibility-verified in order to get a VIC. If we cannot quickly verify eligibility (either immediately or later through a manual check), would Veterans prefer that Vets.gov not allow them to apply at all, or allow them to apply, with the possibility of getting a rejection at a later date?** 

#### Related questions
- In order to issue a VIC to you, we need to verify that you served in the Armed Services and that you were honorably discharged. Would you prefer that we check your eligibility: a) Before you start the application; b) during the application process; c) after you submit your application? (why?) 
-If we could not verify your eligibility for a VIC, would you rather be notified of that before you submitted an application or after? 

6. **It may take a while to identify a vendor who could print ID cards. Does the idea of a digital ID appeal to Veterans? Would they use it? Would they know how to use it? Do they have any concerns about it?** 

#### Related questions
- What would you expect a VIC to look like? 
- We are exploring different formats for a VIC. On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is not very important and 5 is very important, how important is it to you that your VIC be a physical, plastic card? 
- At what benchmarks in the VIC application would you want to be notified? (Application submitted, Application received + ID #, Eligibility Verified, Printed Card Sent...other?)
- How long would you expect it to take between finding out that your VIC application was approved and receiving your card in the mail? 
- Have you heard anything about digital identification, such as a driver's license or other ID you might save on your phone? 
- If the VIC was available immediately in a digital format, how interested would you be? Use a scale of 1-5, where 1 is not at all interested and 5 is very interested.
- Do you have any questions or concerns about digital IDs? 


# Who to Research With? 
- Option 1: Man-on-the-street style: Ask any Veteran if they would be willing to participate in a short interview. 
- Option 2: Recruit Veterans who have given us their email in Phase 1. 
-- Opt 2.1 VA employees who gave us their email in Phase 1. 
- Option 3: Recruit Veterasn from Cohorts who have no experience with VIC. 

# Timeline
Best-case scenario: complete discovery research before end of 2017. Possible that we may need to do research first week of Jan.
