## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Lauren, and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes. We are here today to talk about the Veteran Identification Card. I am going to ask you a series of questions to help my team understand how to make the application process easier for Veterans. 

Before we start, there are a few things I'd like to mention:

- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.   
- There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans' needs. 
- I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. 
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.
- I’ll be recording the audio as we talk today, so that we capture your opinions accurately. Only our conversation will be recorded. We are not sharing screens or using video recording. 
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

Great! Any questions before we get started?

Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. *Start audio and screen recording.*

## Section 0: Warm-Up Questions

- What branch of the military did you serve in? 

- When did you retire or separate? 

- Are you aware of any forms of veteran identification, such as something that might show proof of service, discharge status, or Veteran benefits? 

  - If YES: Which ones? 
  - Any others? 
  - (Prompt if needed: Are you aware of Veteran Health ID Cards, Veteran designation on State ID cards or licenses, etc.) 
  - Do you have any of these forms of identification? 
  - Do you know anyone who does? 

## Section 1: Value of VIC (Not User Voice)

- Have you heard anything about Veteran's ID Cards issued by the VA? 
  - (If YES: What have you heard?) 
  
- If needed: The demand for the Veteran ID card was much higher than the VA anticipated, and we learned from reviewing all of the website feedback that the application process was frustrating. I am working with the team that was brought in to help fix both of those things, and your feedback and answers to my questions will be really helpful. 

- Can you tell me what the requirements are to get a Veteran's ID card? 

- Have you ever tried to apply for a Veteran's ID Card from the VA? 
  - If YES: When? 
  - Which website did you go to to apply?
  - Were you able to complete the application? (If NO: Can you tell me what happened when you tried?)    

- Do you think there are advantages that a VA Veteran ID Card offers that other forms of military or veteran ID do not provide? 
  - If YES: What are the advantages? 
  - (Clarification question if needed: Do you think that the VA Veteran ID Card offers benefits that other Veteran ID cards do not provide? If Yes, what are those benefits?)  
  - (If needed: If you found out that another form of Veteran ID, such as a driver's license with a Veteran marking), gave you the same benefits as a VA-issued Veteran's ID card, would you still be interested in a VA issued Veteran ID card?) 

- In what ways would having a Veterans ID Card issued by the VA help you personally? (Why did you want one?)  

## Section 1: Value of VIC (User Voice) 
- Thank you again for submitting feedback to the Vets.gov website. So to get started, can you tell me about your experience trying to apply for a Veteran ID Card?" 
Questions as needed: 
  - What website did you go to to start? 
  - Were you able to complete the application process? (If NO: At what point in the application did you get stuck?) 
  - Was there anything that you found confusing about the application instructions? 
  - What else do you want me to know about your experience?  

- Thank you so much for sharing that and for taking the time to talk to me today. I'm really sorry you had a bad experience trying to apply for the Veteran ID card. The demand for the card was much higher than anticipated, and we learned from reviewing all of the feedback from users like you that the application process was really frustrating. I am working with the team that was brought in to help fix both of those things, and your feedback and answers to my questions will be really helpful. 

- So, when you came to the website to apply, can you tell me why you were interested in having a Veteran's ID card? 
  - (Clarification follow-up: How would having a VIC help you?)

- Do you think there are advantages that a VA Veteran ID Card offers that other forms of military or veteran ID do not provide? 
  - If YES: What are the advantages? 
  - (Clarification question if needed: Do you think that the VA Veteran ID Card offers benefits that other Veteran ID cards do not provide? If Yes, what are those benefits?)    
  - (If needed: If you found out that another form of Veteran ID, such as a driver's license with a Veteran marking), gave you the same benefits as a VA-issued Veteran's ID card, would you still be interested in a VA issued Veteran ID card?) 

- Can you tell me what the requirements are to get a Veteran's ID card? 

## Section 2: Logging in
- Can you talk about any other times when you have applied for or renewed a government-issued photo ID, such as a driver's license or a passport? How did you do this? What steps did you take? 
  - Have you ever done this online? 
  - (If YES: Did you have to login to a website to apply?)

- In the current version, Veterans need to login using DS Logon or ID.me to access the application. 
  - Do you think you should need to login to a website to apply for a Veteran ID Card? 
  - Do you have any concerns about applying for a VIC on a public-facing website, where you do not have to login?

- What would you want to know about the application process before you started? What information would be most useful to you? 

- Do you have a DS Logon Premium, My HealtheVet Premium, or an ID.me account? 
  - If NO: Would you be willing to register for a new web account in order to apply for a VIC, if you knew it would take 10 minutes to do so, and that you would need to verify your identity by uploading a copy of your license or passport?  

- Would you be willing to upload a copy of your DD214 as part of the application? 

- The VA must obtain proof of identity, proof of military history, and proof of honorable discharge status in order to provide a Veteran ID card. 
  - If you learned that the VA could verify your eligibility for a VIC faster during the application process if you logged in before submitting the application, would that be of interest to you? 
  - If you learned that you could track the status of your VIC application online if you logged in before submitting the application, would that be of interest to you?  
  - If the VA had incorrect information about you in its database that would affect your eligibility for a Veteran ID Card, how could we be most helpful to you in notifying you of that error and helping you correct it? 

- At what benchmarks in the VIC application process would you want to receive notifications from the VA? (Application submitted, Application received + ID #, Eligibility Verified, Printed Card Sent...other?)

- How long do you expect the application process will take from the time you start until you hit submit? 
 
- How long would you expect it to take between finding out that your VIC application was approved and receiving your Veteran ID Card?

- If a Veteran Service Organization or your local VA office could help you complete your Veteran ID card application if you visited them in person, how interested would you be in that option? Use a scale from 1-5, where 1 is not very interested and 5 is very insterested. 

## Section 3: Appearance of Card 
- On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is the least important and 5 is very important, how important is it to you that your Veteran ID Card  indicates which branch or branches of the Armed Services you served in? 

- On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is the least important and 5 is very important, how important is it to you that your Veteran ID Card  features a photo of you? 

- Have you ever uploaded a print document or photo to a website? 
  - Can you tell me more about that experience? 
  - Using a scale from 1-5 where 1 is very difficult and 5 is very easy, how hard was it for you to do so?
  - (If they don't specify how they digitized the document): How did you make the print document or photo digital? 
  - (If they mention any assistive technology, follow up:) Can you tell me more about how you use that device you mentioned? 

- If you had to submit an official passport photo for the VIC application, how easy or difficult would it be for you to get one taken? Use a scale from 1-5 where 1 is very difficult and 5 is very easy.

- If you could take your own photo but it still had to meet passport photo standards, how confident do you feel that you could do that? Use a scale from 1-5 where 1 is not very confident and 5 is very confident.

- What do you think a Veteran ID Card will look like?

## Section 4: Digital vs Print

- We're exploring doing a digital card that you'd be able to pull up on your phone (and in theory could get access to much more quickly than a plastic card).
  - Have you ever heard about or used a digital ID card?
  - Would you be interested in a digital VIC? Do you have any concerns about that?
  - Would you still want a plastic card?

## Closing Interview - 5 minutes

- Do you have any comments or questions about the Veteran ID Card that we have not yet covered today?
