## Section 1: Value of VIC (User Voice) 
- *Tell me about your experience trying to apply for a Veteran ID Card* 
Oh sure. Id be more than happy to. Oh man. Yeah that was frustrating. When I got the email through one of my veterans' associations that it was available, I tried to apply. And I think it was the gosh... I... the um...the check.. kind of creepy to me because my whole career I have had a security clearance so it goes against my vbetter judgement to disclose any of my info to a third party vendor and I'm shocked that the government is using a third party vendor to verify us, and especially over the internet. I'm disappointed and dismayed, given the fact that the VA has lost our information so many times it's not funny, and let our IDs got out in laptops and hard drives.. and the government's been hacked so to have a third party do it just creeps me out. I forget the vendors' name. I forget Id.me. I had alreAdy been credentialed with them and it should have been in cookies in my browser already so I don't know why it didnt work so when I tried it it didn't go through and I later realized that it didn't go through. In about 72 hours the wesbite was broken, and we can't apply at all anyway, giving us messages like Sorry Charlie, you can't apply we will send you a message when you can. You can't even apply for the Id card anymore any way. ... It just reminded me of the Obama era when people were trying to apply for healthcare and hundreds of millions spent on that snafu. I'm an IT professional and I have no patience for that. This is really frustrating. To treat veterans that way and tanatalize them with an opportunity that doesn't materialize is just another slap in the face. After losing two thirds of what our pay should be for 41 years of service and then having stuff like this happened...it's just very frustrating. The red light went up for me that this was fraud and I couldn't verify with the tools that I have as an IT, I'm a former CIO for national defense university for the reserve component... I couldn't verify this website and all of a sudden it's broken...every red flag went up for me and I tried to report it to the DOD. It looked like fraud. I left it and I never looked back. If this was legitimate it shouldn't be. It asked for things it has no business asking for. It originally IDed me through my MyPay credentials and didn't ask for things like that and it never should be asking for images of funky credentials like state IDS cards and stuff. arbage credentials...which anyone can get... the way it's set up and the way it went down didn't feel good to me as a security professional. To leave the site and go to this weird ID.me third party site where it wouldn't see my credentials before... that was odd. It wouldn't verify me - it kept forcing me off the site. The links were broken...even your message didn't seem right. Since you're calling me and talking to me hopefully this is legit. This whole thing and how you contacted me didn't seem legit. Because it was followup to a whole bunch of doo doo - your security certificates looked false. I used a computer that didn't matter if it got hacked for followup. 
If it had come through VA, through an official source. Correct. And said that we're going to be reaching out - it's okay to talk to you, and yeah.

What's weird for me is I'm disabled.... Social security recognizes me as disabled. VA has been sitting on my claim for over a year. I have no access to the VA. I have been paying my own hc and it's a line of duty injury. I was given the gift of microbial xxx 32 of us got it, 7 of us survived, mine went to the lungs not brain or liver. Very expensive drugs. I'm lucky in that sense, but very unlikley in the sense the VA couldn't give a rats fanny. I've done what I thought was a perfect claim and have heard nothing. I'm particularly frustrated even as a med provider with perfect words I still can't get through the nightmare. 
Now that I have tri-care and I'm on the other side of the fence. I see it. Loma Linda. Turning in an application... wow, what a different story. Trying to access the system and not being able to. I've been in every war since vietnam and seen all ages, old to young, all the people I have taken care of, I've been the beficiary. I have a wealth of knowledge, and a wealth of experience. I'm also a receiver. It's important to me. California gives a rats fanny about it all. We have a congressman thats a retired colonel, but she does nothing for us. It's a weird experience, so I'd love to help you. I hear the frustrations to access. and this is one more piece. What you guys tried to do was fantastic but hitting that wall so soon after you started was frustrating to me and to many. ID.me to me because they have a retail presence, the majority of their business of retail I don't like that they have a government division that is mixed in with retail. When they send me ads about all the retail I get nervous - seems like a big target to hack  - I would if I were on the nefarious side of that.

  - *What website did you go to to start?* 
  - *Were you able to complete the application process? (If NO: At what point in the application did you get stuck?)* 
  - *Was there anything that you found confusing about the application instructions?* 
  - *What else do you want me to know about your experience?*  

- *So, when you came to the website to apply, can you tell me why you were interested in having a Veteran's ID card?* 
  - *How would having a VIC help you?*

- *Do you think there are advantages that a VA Veteran ID Card offers that other forms of military or veteran ID do not provide?* 
  - *If YES: What are the advantages?* 
  - *Do you think that the VA Veteran ID Card offers benefits that other Veteran ID cards do not provide? If Yes, what are those benefits?*    My retired ID card doesn't mean much to anybody. Because it's not a CAC card which is what everyone recognizes and bc the DOD doesn't care about us enough to give us a cac card - it's what you need to get into a computer or anything - but bc they don't care about us enough... everyone else in the world has a recignizable cac card with a chip to ID you. Hvaing this card was just one more thing to atleast show that even though I'm a member of BAB? I'm still alive and breathing. I go to other states and they hail their veterans and have it on their plates and drivers licenses the few things that are left. I'm the only one flying s flag. No patriotism...
  - *If you found out that another form of Veteran ID, such as a driver's license with a Veteran marking), gave you the same benefits as a VA-issued Veteran's ID card, would you still be interested in a VA issued Veteran ID card?* 
To be honest with you, I'm leaving CA as soon as I can since the governor committed treason and named us a sanctuary state. So I'm leaving here until I can find a state where I don;t have to be around pot smokin dirtbags who don't care about america. They don't care about tsa regulations. They're just so anti federal government here since they don't support the gov in any way shape or form other than have their 
- *Can you tell me what the requirements are to get a Veteran's ID card?* 
You've got to be in one of the eight classes of eligibility for the VA care. You have to be honorably discharged but your percentage disability is where you're at in the food chain of acces to care. If you're category 8 for example thats destitute, maybe not service related but if you meet income deadlines. The one that was being offered online? It just showed that you were a member of the armed forces. It really didn't pertain to me in that sense. Unless it's at a gate somewhere. The public doesn't recognize the card that I carry. 
## Section 2: Logging in
- *Can you talk about any other times when you have applied for or renewed a government-issued photo ID, such as a driver's license or a passport? How did you do this? What steps did you* take? 
I applied for the GOES card - I have the global entry card and that had to be done online. I had to go to the GOES website and put in my id information there and make an appt inmy case in hawaii I was then imaged and biometricked at the station in Hawaii and then after a personal interview they issued the ID card. Then had to get reinterviewed. Same as passeport you start online but need a physical location> You scan an iris so it's pretty heavy duty stuff.
  - *Have you ever done this online?* 
  - *Did you have to login to a website to apply?*

- *In the current version, Veterans need to login using DS Logon or ID.me to access the application.* 
  - *Do you think you should need to login to a website to apply for a Veteran ID Card?* 
  - *Do you have any concerns about applying for a VIC on a public-facing website, where you do not have to login?*

- *What would you want to know about the application process before you started? What information would be most useful to you?* 
It would have been nice to know that you if you were were using, if ID me was the only verification source, I'm not sure why would have needed to use that. IDme should not have access to DOD enrollment records. If they do and they get hacked and have access to the entire DOD database that concerns me. APHIES - all the exchanges they can no purchase online at any exchange. They can now buy online. I'm curious if ID me is the platform for people to enroll... those are the folks you're trying to reach to and it seems like the same database as the exchange folks. How do you that is the question and I'd want to know that hey you're able to use these services now...I'd want to know that the DoD through I'm not a social media person, I've never tweeted or IMed or whatever the heck is done these days because that's nonsense and a dangerous thing in my world to do. I know that's the platform for younger people. To me that's the enemy. That's where the enemy goes to live. 
- *Do you have a DS Logon Premium, My HealtheVet Premium, or an ID.me account?* 
Yeah I have DS login that's what alarmed me when that wasn't accepted for this application. Id me wanted a picture of my drivers license and ss card that you juat wouldn't be sending in over the internet. No one in the I'm just a veteran world would have one. About 5 years ago we lost all our privileges - if you're not a retiree and you're done with your term you can't access DOD no longer have .mil email address. The only reason I have anything is accessing MyPay.
  - *If NO: Would you be willing to register for a new web account in order to apply for a VIC, if you knew it would take 10 minutes to do so, and that you would need to verify your identity by uploading a copy of your license or passport?*  

- *Would you be willing to upload a copy of your DD214 as part of the application?* 

- *The VA must obtain proof of identity, proof of military history, and proof of honorable discharge status in order to provide a Veteran ID card.* 
  - *If you learned that the VA could verify your eligibility for a VIC faster during the application process if you logged in before submitting the application, would that be of interest to you?* 
  - *If you learned that you could track the status of your VIC application online if you logged in before submitting the application, would that be of interest to you?*  
  - *If the VA had incorrect information about you in its database that would affect your eligibility for a Veteran ID Card, how could we be most helpful to you in notifying you of that error and helping you correct it?* 

- *At what benchmarks in the VIC application process would you want to receive notifications from the VA? (Application submitted, Application received + ID #, Eligibility Verified, Printed Card Sent...other?)*

- *How long do you expect the application process will take from the time you start until you hit submit?* 
Probably 5 minutes. 
- *How long would you expect it to take between finding out that your VIC application was approved and receiving your Veteran ID Card?*
What I actually thought would happen would be with in once I saw ID me I thought I would be automatically approved and get an instant PDF I could print and then the physical card would come in the next 10-15 days. But I thought I would have something I could print on my color printer in the meantime.
- *If a Veteran Service Organization or your local VA office could help you complete your Veteran ID card application if you visited them in person, how interested would you be in that option? Use a scale from 1-5, where 1 is not very interested and 5 is very insterested.* 

## Section 3: Appearance of Card 
- *On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is the least important and 5 is very important, how important is it to you that your Veteran ID Card  indicates which branch or branches of the Armed Services you served in?* 
Which branch 5
- *On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is the least important and 5 is very important, how important is it to you that your Veteran ID Card  features a photo of you?* 
5
- *Have you ever uploaded a print document or photo to a website?* 
  - *Can you tell me more about that experience?* 
  - *Using a scale from 1-5 where 1 is very difficult and 5 is very easy, how hard was it for you to do so?*
  - *How did you make the print document or photo digital?* 
  - *Can you tell me more about how you use that assistive device you mentioned?* 

- *If you had to submit an official passport photo for the VIC application, how easy or difficult would it be for you to get one taken? Use a scale from 1-5 where 1 is very difficult and 5 is very easy.*
It would 67 miles each way trip for me to do it... to do a passport photo. I would have to drive down to costco and it would cost money, and it would be hardship for many people. Can I give you a comment? If you're going to ask, I'll give you some feedback, if you ask a Marine the same question you will always get a HooAH must for a Marine to have that on their card. Not so much CG or AF but Marines yes. It will be on their car. It IS their logo. The older I get because of my security background I'm less apt to self-identify. I don't have that on my vehicle. Even though I'm top ranked. Now I don't want to be real sniper shoot with ISIS real threat in the US right now. Those are really potential to be IED. I don't want to be targeted and have stickers on the car and stuff. I have to do a reset in my mind to do that. I'm proud of being in the Army, but it's not a must-have. To prevent fraud and to make the ID more meaningful and make it look like a usable ID to have your branch and photo I think is a must, meaningful identity tool.
- *If you could take your own photo but it still had to meet passport photo standards, how confident do you feel that you could do that? Use a scale from 1-5 where 1 is not very confident and 5 is very confident.*
5

## Section 4: Digital vs Print

- *What do you think a Veteran ID Card will look like?*

- *We're exploring doing a digital card that you'd be able to pull up on your phone (and in theory could get access to much more quickly than a plastic card).*
  - *Have you ever heard about or used a digital ID card?*
  - *Would you be interested in a digital VIC? Do you have any concerns about that?* I'd love that.
  - *Would you still want a plastic card?* Yes. 

## Closing Interview

- *Do you have any comments or questions about the Veteran ID Card that we have not yet covered today?*  
Would you have the ability to verify, since you're using ID me would this be classically referred to as a TSA approved. Government issued ID. I think you might even be able to partner with senators and congressmen to partner with DMV offices or ss offices to help with that too
