# Veteran ID Card User Experience Research

## Discovery (January 2-12, 2018)

**Goal:** The goal of the discovery research is to inform design decisions to inform the design of the new VIC application. 

In particular, we are interested in learning about: 
- Value of VIC: Why do Veterans want this? 
- Logging In: Value add of logging in using ID.me/MHV/DS Logon
- Photo: Do Veterans want their photo on the card and how feasible is it for them to do this? 
- Appearance: How do Veterans feel about a digital option?

## Usability (Jan 22-26, 2018)

**Goal:** The goal of the usability research was to test the flow of the new application, including the new photo cropping tool, with real users. 

In particular, we want to learn about: 
- Do Veterans find the new instructions and information provided easier to understand? 
- Do Veterans choose to login or not, given the option? 
- Are Veterans able to use the photo cropper tool? What issues do they encounter?
- Are Veterans able to use the DD214 upload? What issues do they encounter?
- Do Veterans feel better informed about next steps?

Recordings are audio files shared through slack due to file size. 

**Analysis**
During this research study, the product team, content team, and engineers were invited to participate as observers in the sessions. Paris and Lauren solicited comments from the observers to include as part of the analysis. Analysis was conducted using post-its on a wall at 811 Vermont and was transferred into a [*Trello board*](https://trello.com/b/Svowg4H5/vic-research-post-its) for the full remote Rainbows team. Notes are also in [*Optimal Workshop*](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/a/adhoc/reframer/projects/12525), but are not coded. 

**Readouts**
The team did a readout for the Vets.gov end-of-sprint demo, as well as a readout for the stakeholders

## Lessons Learned from Research 
### Recruiting 
- The Uservoice/Feedback tickets proved to be a useful source of relevant participants for the discovery study. May be worth coming up with a system to track and use this pool of users for future studies.  
- Make sure that users are abundantly aware that they need a computer, need to download Go To Meeting, and be prepared before the meeting. May be useful to get users on 10 minutes before with Kristin. 
- IF government shuts down but we're still conducting research, extra reminders are in order. 

### Study Design 
- Testing using both a prototype and a staging site is feasible, but requires a lot of preparation. Need to be prepared to both share a screen with a user and give user mouse access. See conversation guide for preparation guidance. 
- Since we were testing with users uploading a photo, we needed to be prepared for them to not have one available, and to use ours instead. We elected to do this by placing it on the moderator's desktop and limiting what users could access in Finder. 

### Analysis 
- Need to guide engineers/product teams/content teams new to research to not jump from observations to solutions. Its worth further conversations about how to bring them into the process meaningfully. 
- The post-it method works better for a team that is working together in a space or working together at a remote site. When the whole team is remote, it has an exclusionary effect. We moved the post-it board into Trello so the team could see it, and shared links to Optimal Sort so the team could review quotations after the fact. It could be interesting to do a team Trello board, managed by lead researcher, for future sessions. 
- Ideally, allow more time for analysis. We lucked out that the government shut down postponed the offsite, which allowed us to be analyzing and researching simultaneously.
