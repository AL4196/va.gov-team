## GoToMeeting logistics

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute*

*In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked*

*Make sure the participant is using the desktop application, so that we are able to both share screen and that we can pass mouse control to them. If we cannot make either work, run test by showing your screen and having them tell you what they want you to do.*] 

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 5 minutes 
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauren, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We are here today to talk about the Veteran Identification Card, and we're looking forward to hearing from you how we can make the next iteration of the application process easier for Veterans. 

Before we start, there are a few things I'd like to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally move us along to the next topic. 

- **Today, you'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** These are concepts from the new Veteran ID Card application that are not live, so some parts may not work the way you are used to on other websites. We are using these for this conversation so that we can get your feedback about what works and what could use further work. We will be using fake user data, and you will not be submitting an actual application. 

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the application to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. 

- **Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. 

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.**

- Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you? 

- OK I'm going to start the recording now. 

## Warmup
*Cohorts Users*
- Have you heard anything about the Veteran ID Card? 
  - If yes, what have you heard? 
  
- What do you think the requirements are to get a VIC? 

- Are you planning to get one? Why/why not? 

*UserVoice Users*
- Thank you again for submitting feedback to the Vets.gov website. So to get started, can you tell me about your experience trying to apply for a Veteran ID Card?" Questions as needed:
  - What website did you go to to start?
  - Were you able to complete the application process? (If NO: At what point in the application did you get stuck?)
  - Was there anything that you found confusing about the application instructions?
  - What else do you want me to know about your experience?
  
Thank you so much for sharing that and for taking the time to talk to me today. I'm really sorry you had a bad experience trying to apply for the Veteran ID card. The demand for the card was much higher than anticipated, and we learned from reviewing all of the feedback from users like you that the application process was really frustrating. I am working with the team that was brought in to help fix both of those things in the next version, and your feedback and answers to my questions today will be really helpful.

- Why were you interested in a VIC? 

## Introduction Page

(*if we can test on their machine*) 
- To start, I'd like you to click on the link that I've pasted into the chat window of GoToMeeting. This is the first protoype that we will be interacting with today. I am going to pass the presenter role to you, so that we can see your screen as you interact with the prototype. 

*Give users this link: [https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/3BFFG9EU8MA#/screens](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/3BFFG9EU8MA#/screens)* 

*OR*

(if they cannot or won't do that and we need to run the test on my machine): 
-To start, I'm going to open the first prototype. I will then pass over mouse control to you. This will allow you to steer on my screen. You may experience difficulty scrolling normally. Please use the up and down arrows or use the scroll bar on the side of your screen to manually scroll. 

- Please take a moment to read the content on this page. 

- What stuck out to you as being the most important? 

- Do you have any questions after reading this content? (Was anything confusing?) 

- Can you summarize the requirements for completing this application? 

- After reading this page, what would you do next? (Go ahead and do that)
  - If needed: Do you have the requirements accessible? 
  - If needed: How do you think you would access the application? 
  - If needed: Did you notice the green button? 
  - If needed: How could we make the next step clearer? 

## Application Page
Again, I'd like you to take a moment and review the content on this page. Pretend that I am not here, and spend as much time reviewing this content as you would if you were on your own. Let me know when you're done. 

- Please summarize the information that stuck out most for you on this page. 
  - Did anything you read surprise you?

- What would be your next step? 

- Today I'm going to have you complete the application as a logged out user, so please click on the button labeled "start application". 

## Veteran Information Page 1
Since we are working with a prototype today, I am not going to have you fill out your personal information on this screen. Please click in the name field, and "fake user data" will appear. You do not have to enter any personal information for this part of today's session. 

- Do you have any questions about why we are asking for this information? 
  - If needed: We use this information to help us confirm that you are a veteran who has been honorably discharged. 
  
- Please go ahead and do whatever you would do next. 

## Veteran Information Page 2.

## Photo 

## Pathway 1: [We are able to get a staging account for users [and] user is comfortable using own computer.] 

- Now we are going to interact with a demo web tool. Please click continue. 

*URL if needed: Staging photo tool: [https://staging.vets.gov/vic-v2/documents/photo?skip](https://staging.vets.gov/vic-v2/documents/photo?skip) *

- I am going to give you a username and password to type in to access the tool. 

username: vic [SAY: lowercase victor-india-charlie]
password: usertest [SAY: lowercase uniform-sierra-echo-romeo-tango-echo-sierra-tango]

- Please take a moment to look at the content on this screen. Do you have a photo that meets these requirements? 
  - Is it something you think you could find quickly? 
  - Would you feel comfortable uploading it to this test site? (Nothing will be saved or submitted). 
  (**If NO: reroute to Pathway 2**). 
  
- Please go ahead and use this tool to upload and adjust your photo to meet the requirements. Please talk aloud as you do so, so I better understand what steps you are taking and why. If you find anything frustrating or confusing as part of this process, please feel free to share that feedback too. 
  
- [After they have uploaded and cropped] How confident do you feel that this photo matches the requirements listed above? Use a scale from 1 to 5 where 1 is the least confident and 5 is the most confident. 

- How was this tool to use? Use a scale from 1 to 5 where 1 is very difficult and 5 is very easy. 
  - If needed: How could we make this tool easier to use? 

- How confident do you feel that you could use this tool again on your own in the real application? Use that same scale where 1 is not confident and 5 is very confident. 

- Do you have any questions other about this tool? 

- What would you do next? 


### Pathway 2. We are NOT able to get a staging account [OR] user is not comfortable using own computer. 
- The next part of the application is a demo tool, and we will interact with it online. 

**If coming from PATHWAY 1, start here.** 

- I am going to take back presenter mode for this next part. 

*URL if needed: Staging photo tool: [https://staging.vets.gov/vic-v2/documents/photo?skip](https://staging.vets.gov/vic-v2/documents/photo?skip) *

username: vic [SAY: lowercase victor-india-charlie]
password: usertest [SAY: lowercase uniform-sierra-echo-romeo-tango-echo-sierra-tango]

I am going to pass mouse control of my screen to you so that you can interact with the tool. 

- Please take a moment to look at the content on this screen. We are going to use a photo of me for this, so you will see what I look like! 

- After reading this, what would your next step be? 
  - We are going to navigate to my desktop. Please click the upload button. Select the photo on the desktop called "Lauren_VIC". 

- Please go ahead and use this tool to upload and adjust this photo to meet the requirements listed above. Please talk aloud as you do so, so I better understand what steps you are taking and why. If you find anything frustrating or confusing as part of this process, please feel free to share that feedback too.

As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to offer you a $25 gift either as an Amazon Gift Card or through Paypal. Do you have a preference?

Great, is it ok for us to send that gift to the same address we used to communicate with you about scheduling this test? If no Ok, we'll follow up with an email after this session to get the right email from you in writing.

Thanks! Lastly, would you like to share this feedback opportunity with other Veterans or Veteran groups you're a part of? If so, I can send you an email with a little blurb so you can easily connect folks to our team.
