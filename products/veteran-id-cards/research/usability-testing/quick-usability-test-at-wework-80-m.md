Looks like a passport photo - ok, that was my first question

Normally don't read that much instructions

Create an account…this is the DS Login. Does it link to that database?

So that would autopopulate—how would that work?

So that pulled the actual file in, which is cool. 

Super slick. That's one of my biggest grievances - you have all this information, you know everything, why are you making me do this?

Checks to see what happens if you have fewer than 10 digits in phone number

Reads description of photo - we've run into a problem, network request failed



Impression: that's one of the things I've been wondering about. I've never - my experience was I did a lot of the stuff ahead of time, linked up with VA for my application, called and gave my first appointment for clinics, showed up and knew name of doctor but didn't have ID, needed to get one there. "No, this is my first time here!" Being able to apply online and have that set to go ahead of time will get that feeling of belonging within the Veterans' community - everything else you need to be proactive, just one little barrier but it's more than just that. So as soon as you're out you can get it sent to you. Process was easy for the healthcare one for the VA clinics, then led to an awkward situation but didn't stop me from doing what I needed to do.



I've been looking for this, since some hotels and stuff have discounts. Can get thru Virginia but they charge and the website doesn't work; that was 3 months ago and I never came back to that. I knew this was in the works, so this is good to see.



Where? First guess would be to sign in myself. Request my records - maybe
