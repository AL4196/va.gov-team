# Research Plan for Usability Research 
(see also: [Issue 6770](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/6770))

## Research Questions
1. Do Veterans report that they feel adequately informed of the process and requirements for the VIC application before they get started? 
2. Given the option, do Veterans choose to login or not, and why? 
3. Are Veterans able to successfully upload a photo using the new photo tool? (If not, what additional guidance or support is needed?) 
4. Do Veterans have a way to upload their supporting documentation (DD214)? 
5. Do Veterans report that the information on the confirmation page is helpful?

## Research Subjects
1) Uservoice Veterans who have tried to apply
2) Cohorts users who have not tried to apply.
