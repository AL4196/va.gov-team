# Discovery Project Brief & Planning Template

This doc should be filled out during different stages of the discovery sprint process. See the [Discovery Sprint How-to](DiscoverySprintHowTo.md) for details on the whole process.

## PROJECT BRIEF
_To be filled out with a Vets.gov lead prior to starting discovery work._

### Project Name
Veteran Verification Online Badge

### Problem Statement / How Might We statements
- Veterans can't display their veteran status in online profiles like LinkedIn, Facebook. 
- People who want to hire veterans or offer them perqs don't have a trustworthy way of verifying a veteran's status.
- Veterans may want to display something on their phones when visiting businesses to show they are a veteran (though note the overlap with the printed veteran ID card project, so this may be deemed out of scope).

## DISCOVERY PLANNING
_To be filled out by Discovery Sprint Team._

Note: revise above sections as needed

### Project Details

* The extant standard for online badges is the OpenBadge spec (https://openbadges.org/).
  * Vets.gov could act as a badge issuer, providing assertions that a given vets.gov user is a veteran.
  * Veterans could display their vets.gov badge on LinkedIn and other sites that support OpenBadge. 

* Other technical background
  * Within Vets.gov we have all the necessary data (via our eMIS integration) to say whether a user is a veteran or not. 
  * 

* What don't we know?
  * How smooth is the process for including an OpenBadge hosted by Vets.gov in a LinkedIn profile?
  * What other sites of interest support OpenBadge?
  * Much of the documentation around OpenBadges revolves around the Mozilla Backpack site. Ideally we would not require users to open yet another account to display their Vets.gov badges, but it's not clear if this intermediary is needed or not.
  * Will potential hirers on LinkedIn trust a verified veteran badge? What information do we need to display to make viewers trust the badge?
  * What information do we need to display to avoid replay attacks? (User B copying the link to User A's badge and displaying it in their own profile)

* Are any of the above assumptions that need to be verified?
* How are we going to find out answers? (There are tons of different methods to choose from depending on your project goals, resources, and time constraints. Checkout the methods and templates provided in our Discovery Toolkit and consult the [Research Team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-research/blob/master/README.md).)
* What kinds of users are likely to benefit from solving this problem (bonus points for our personas)?
* Who do we need to talk to (stakeholders, Veterans, MHV Coordinators, etc.)? (Try to get a wide variety of people to get a range of perspectives â€“ both higher ups and people on the ground doing the work. Meet with people in person whenever possible.)
* What secondary research should we do (google, facebook, internal documents)?
* Are there any intentional project constraints (things we're intentionally deeming out of scope)?
* Are there any challenges or risks that will make this discovery sprint hard to complete (tricky politics, technology complications, etc.)?


### Timeline
See also: [sample discovery sprint schedule](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Research/Discovery/SampleDiscoverySprintSchedule.md).

* Are there any hard and fast deadlines for completing the discovery work?
