# Research Plan for Rainbows, VIC landing page, August 2018

## Goals
1. This document outlines research for the new VIC landing page.
2. [Background of the VIC intiative overall](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Products/Records/Veteran%20Identification%20Card%20v2), [goals of this landing page here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Records/Veteran%20Identification%20Card%20v2/Landing%20Page%20-%20Aug%202018/project_brief.md)
3. Research questions
    - Do Veterans understand the different types of Veteran identification cards and the differences between them?
    - Are Veterans able to determine their eligibility for each type of ID card?
    - Do Veterans know what action to take to apply for ID cards they are eligible for?
    - Do Veterans know what to expect after they apply for an ID card?
4. **Hypothesis**: Veterans may not be aware of the different types of Veteran ID options available to them or the differences between them. Providing a page that outlines each ID and its eligibility requirements could empower the Veteran to apply for the appropriate ID or designation and begin using it to receive discounts and show their Veteran status.

## Method 
- Remote moderated usability testing with a live front-end staging environment. 
- This method will allow us to test the content of the landing page, form flow, interactions, and error states in a realistic environment.
- We'll conduct the research online using GoToMeeting to screenshare and allow mouse and keyboard control.

## Participants and Recruitment
1. Participant criteria: 
    - We would like to speak with 6-8 Veteran participants representing all branches of the Armed Forces with an even split of men and women, and at least one person in each of the following age brackets: 18-30, 31-50, 50+.
    - All participants must be have applied for and used one (any) of VA's identity cards in the past
    - We would like for at least one participant to have a disability rating of 30% or greater.

2. Recruiting 
    - Lauren Alexanderson will initiate the request from the team at Perigean Technologies, who will recruit participants
