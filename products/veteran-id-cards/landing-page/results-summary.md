# Background

The goal of this research is to evaluate the content of the Veteran ID Card landing page, and find out if Veterans could come away with an understanding of what ID cards are available to them, the differences between them, and what actions they would need to take to apply for them if they want to.


# Methods

### Dates
The research sessions took place Wednesday, August 15-Friday, August 17.

### Participants
8 people participated in the usability sessions, and each lasted about 30 minutes. 

- All participants were Veterans, representing service in the Army, Navy, National Guard, and Marine Corps.
- Two participants were women, six were men.
- Two participants were African American, six were Caucasian.
- Six participants had a disability rating of 10% or higher.
- The age range of participants was 46-72.
- The participants resided in 6 different states: California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Ohio, North Carolina, and Tennessee. 

### What We Did
We conducted moderated, remote usability sessions where participants viewed a live protype of the Veteran ID Card landing page, [which can be seen here](https://vetsgov-pr-8159.herokuapp.com/ID-card-types/). The participants were asked to read through the content of the page and answer questions about their interpretation of the content, what actions it would prompt them to take, if any, and how they felt about it.

# Results & Takeaways

### The content presented on the landing page is generally easy for Veterans to understand _unless the Veteran has dyslexia_.

Most Veterans were able to succinctly describe the purpose of the landing page, and most found it useful and reported that they learned something new about ID card options.

However, one participant had dyslexia and reported that she had a very difficult time scanning the page and found it overwhelming. It took her longer than other participants to understand the content because it was difficult for her to separate out the different sections, and she had to read slowly and with intensified concentration. 

For a dyslexic user, the amount of information overload can be so intense that she often makes a trip to her local VA office, and recommends the same to her fellow Veterans. Improving the readability for this page could have a big impact on the steps people take to find information and get answers to questions.

>There is a tremendous amount of information at the VA, and when you go to the website, you get bogged down with so many things so it is hard to tell people where to go on the website. I'm much more likely to tell them to go in at JP [VA Health Center].

**Conclusion**: The content of the page communicated the concepts well, but some design tweaks could help ease the amount of effort required for comprehension. Increase the contrast in section headings to create clearer chunks of content, and make the typographic hierarchy more apparent. We should also regularly test our work with participants who have dyslexia.

### Veterans have some form of Veteran ID, but many are unaware of which one they have, or the range of benefits it offers them.

All of the participants had previously applied for and successfully received some form of Veteran identification. When asked which type of card they had, 5/8 participants were unsure of what theirs was. Even when asked if their card was represented on the page, the participants weren't confident theirs matched the descriptions.

**Conclusion**: Knowing the name of the ID card in and of itself is less important, but the page should enable a Veteran to determine which card they have so that they can understand its benefits, and help them make decisions about whether they need to apply for any other types of ID.

### A visual representation of each type of ID would help Veterans understand which one they have and the differences between them.

When asked if any of the cards on the landing page represented the one the Veteran held, 5/8 participants either gave a verbal description of their card, or mentioned that if they could see a picture of one they would be able to more accurately assess. One of the participants asked if she could switch over to video so that she could show her ID card, because that would be easier than describing it.

**Conclusion**: Having a photo or illustration of the card types would help a Veteran better understand the content of the page, and therefore make a more conclusive decision about any actions they would take.

### Most Veterans wouldn't apply for another card

Most participants indicated that they wouldn't take any actions based on what they understood from this landing page. After reading through the different options, they felt that the cards they already had gave them everything they needed. Many of them also realized they had more IDs than they originally thought after reading the descriptions.

**Conclusion**: That's great! One of the key goals of this page is to help Veterans determine if there are any actions steps they should take to get a new ID card, and if they can decide the answer is _no_ with confidence, then we've succeeded.

### It's unclear what to do if a Veteran needs to replace their ID card.

One participant indicated that she has lost several of her IDs, and expected this page to provide guidance on how to replace them. When asked what steps she would take to replace her card, she mentioned she would visit her local VA help desk in person and ask there.

**Conclusion**: We should provide information about how to replace missing ID cards on this page, and links to the relevant places.
