# Research Plan for Rainbows, VIC landing page, Date TBD

## Goals

This research is a result of the findings of the [previous research study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Records/Veteran%20Identification%20Card%20v2/Landing%20Page%20-%20Aug%202018/research/results-summary.md) on the usability of the Veteran ID Card Landing page, in which many participants indicated how useful it would be to have some sort of visual aid to help them understand the ID cards that are presented on the page.
1. This document outlines another round of research for the new VIC landing page.
2. [Background of the VIC intiative overall](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Products/Records/Veteran%20Identification%20Card%20v2), [goals of this landing page here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Records/Veteran%20Identification%20Card%20v2/Landing%20Page%20-%20Aug%202018/project_brief.md)
