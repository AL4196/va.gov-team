# Supporting Documentation from VIC 1.0

We have accepted DD214, DD 256 and 257 and NG22.  So far even our older Vets have had these docs if they were not recognized in the VA data base.  These docs also show the completion of their obligated service commitment.  DD214 is applicable to all the services under current policy one day in a deployed theater the reservist or NG should receive a DD214.  

HRC issues a Transcript of Military Records (DA Form 1569) or Statement of Service (AHRC Form 2496-E). These forms are authorized replacements for the DD Form 214.  These can be used as they will have the required info on tour and discharge type.  

If a certificate of discharge is sent in it only shows the final date, it should be accompanied by the order which will state service, tour dates and COD.  

There may be docs that are not on this list that if we look at and may verify the info needed.  If we see 6 months we know they did not complete a tour.  

Our Vets back to the 50’s and 60’s are sending in DD214.  Reserve and NG and CG are the ones that we do have to look at carefully if they show something different since there were unit level discharges but the 256, 257, and NG22 are pretty common.  Military services are supposed to be moving to DD214 but you have older vets coming in which is why you have to be open to the submission if it is not in this small group of authorized docs.
