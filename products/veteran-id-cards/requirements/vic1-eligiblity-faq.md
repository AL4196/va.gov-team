**About Veterans Identification Card**

Public Law 114-31 established the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015, requiring the department to issue an identification card to all Veterans that request a card and present a DD-214 or other document that validates service in the Armed Forces (all Military Services to include active, Reserve Component and National Guard) of the United States.  This change effectively mandates that all Veterans that have an honorable or general (under honorable conditions) discharge from the United States Armed Forces be issued a Veteran Identification Card (VIC).

Veterans who already have a DoD Identification Card (retiree or other); a Veterans Health Identification Card (VHIC); or a State issued Veteran Identification Card or your Department of Motor Vehicles has marked your license and identifies you as a Veteran – do not need to apply for the Veterans Identification Card (VIC).  Your current ID provides you with the ability to access and take advantage of discounted goods or services offered to Veterans.  Veterans who have no identification at all should request this card if you have an Honorable or General (Under Honorable Conditions) discharge.  If you have any of the above mentioned cards, they serve this same purpose and a VIC is not needed.  We want to ensure that Veterans who have no identification at all can enjoy the same discounted goods and services that our VETS do that have identification already.

VA uses an authoritative database, through Department of Defense; with all service members discharge information.

You can find your nearest personnel office at: http://www.dmdc.osd.mil/rsl/ or Visit the DEERS website at https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/bwe/indexAction.do.  You may need to 
request a military review to your military service by submitting a DD Form 149 for a correction or DD Form 293 for review of discharge or dismissal.  More information is available at www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/correct-service-records.html.  

**Were You or Are You Currently Active duty**
Any service member that served their obligated commitment or retired and was discharged with an honorable or General (Under Honorable Conditions) is eligible.  

Retired service members already have government issued identification and do not need to apply for the VIC.

Service members that were discharged in either of these discharge statuses are eligible.  If you already have a government issued identification card showing Veteran status, you do not need to apply for the VIC (this might include the Veterans Health Identification Card or any Department of Defense identification card such as CAC or PIV or Retiree Identification Card or state issued Veteran Identification Cards or even the Department of Motor Vehicle Driver’s License with Veteran marker (check with your state). 

**Were You Or Are You Reserve or National Guard** 
Reserve or National Guard (all services to include Coast Guard) that completed their obligated commitment honorably are eligible.  

Reserve or National Guard that have any active duty time 90 days or greater or deployment time of one or more days will receive a DD Form 214 from their military service.  

If you completed your obligated commitment with no active duty time credited you should have received a DD Form 256 or 257 for your discharge from Reserve or a NGB Form 22 if you served your commitment in the National Guard.

Uncharacterized or Unknown discharge status may require additional information.  You will be notified by a system generated message of what steps you need to take.  We will likely ask you to provide a copy of your last DD Form 214 that shows a discharge other than Uncharacterized.  An Unknown status may appear for several reasons (if you had a change to your military records and that data did not pass to VA; your record did not pass to VA before the automated transfer of data from DMDC or a variety of other reasons) if an unknown characterization is shown as the discharge status we will ask you to send us a copy of your last DD Form 214 for verification.  

If you already have a government issued identification card showing Veteran status, you do not need to apply for the VIC (this might include the Veterans Health Identification Card or any Department of Defense identification card such as CAC or PIV or Retiree Identification Card or state issued Veteran Identification Cards or even the Department of Motor Vehicle Driver’s License with Veteran marker (check with your state).
