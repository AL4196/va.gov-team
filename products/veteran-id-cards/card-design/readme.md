# Official Sources of Seals for the Veteran ID Cards 

In our research with Veterans, many asked that their military branch be represented on the VIC in addition to the VA seal. We went through official channels to get permission to use the seals on the Veteran ID Card. The seals have been uploaded to github, so the team has access to them; however, we explicitly do NOT have permission to use these for ANY other purpose than on the Veteran ID Cards.
