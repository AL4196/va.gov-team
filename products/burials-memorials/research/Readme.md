## What is the best page structure for the Burials & Memorials pages?

Today there are 3 benefits living under the burials & memorials umbrella.

1. **Burial planning:** Home > Burials and Memorials > Burial Planning

   Users: Veterans themselves, or their survivors & dependents

   Enters into pre-need application.

2. **Burial Allowance:** Home > Burials and Memorials > Survivors and Dependents > Burial Planning

   Users: Survivors and dependents of the veterans

   Enters into burials application.

3. **Compensation**: Home > Burials and Memorials > Survivors and Dependents > Compensation for Survivors and Dependents 

   Users: Survivors and dependents of the veterans

   *Note: This one feels like it doesn't belong in the "Burials & Memorials" category?*



#### **Hypothesis:** 

Since there isn't a clear line between which benefits is exclusively for veterans VS their survivors and dependets, we should explore designs similar to the multi form currently in EDU benefits, with the following scenarios:

1. I am a veteran planning for my burial —> go to burial planning
2. I am the survivor or dependent of a recently deceased veteran, and I am planning for his/her burial —> go to burial planning
3. I am the survivor or dependent of a deceased veteran. I am looking to get reimbursement for the burial of the veteran —> go to burial allowance



**Questions:** 

- I am a survivor of a deceased veteran who died in the line of duty. Where should I go to find out if I am eligible for compensation from the VA?
- As a survivor of a deceased veteran, is it clear to me where I can find out about information of all the burial & memorial benefits that me and my family might qualify, and apply for them?
- As a veteran, is it clear to to me that I can plan ahead for my burial?
