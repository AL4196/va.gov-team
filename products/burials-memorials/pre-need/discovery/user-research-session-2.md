## Conversation Guide and Response

* Did you know that you could apply to be buried in a national cemetery at any time?
  * Yes.
* If so, how did you find out?
  * Found out while looking around the VA website.
* Do you know what qualifies you to be buried in a national cemetery?
  * No. Didn't really look for this information because wants to hold off on thinking about what happens when she dies for as long as possible, but feels like she could have found the info if she'd wanted to dig into it a bit. She says she should look into it now since she's getting surgery soon.
* Do you want to be buried in a national cemetery?
  * Yes.
* Have you applied already to be buried in a national cemetery? If so, could you describe how and your thoughts about it?
  * No.

* Could you review this page and tell me what you think? What is confusing to you? What would you do next?
  * Pretty straightforward, but would assume "Apply Online" (in breadcrumb) would be an active link. 
  - Language feels too formal. This pertains mainly to the "This application is equivalent to" language, but also in general.
  - Assume "Burials and Memorials" would be what VA provides and "Burial Planning" would provide information on living wills and other things to do to plan for one's future death, etc.
  - The information within "Gather these documents" feels like too much info in each bullet. Suggest separating out elements like "Full name," "Gender," "Social Security number or Veteran ID" into their own bullets. This is very important for someone who lost a loved one recently and is stressed out.
  - The language of "If the deceased was married," and language within other bullets under "You may also need" feels too formal and confusing. Suggest revising to, "If the deceased was married, the following information is required:" or something to that effect.
  - "The Veteran's zip code and county at the time of death" is redundant because it would already be provided on the death certificate.
  - "Veteran whose spouse has already died..." could be reworded to something that feels like less of a mouthful.
  - For "Your cemetery of choice," would like to see a link here to a list of national cemeteries.
  - For "Type of gravesite memorial," headstone is clear, but no idea what a marker or niche cover is. Suggest simpler language and/or examples/explanations for clarity.
  - For "Type of burial," it's tricky to be talking about casket/urn size. How many people would know about this?
  - "Whether you want military honors..." could be reworded to something like "Requested military honors" and then bullets for each item.
  - The link "Learn about other ways to memorialize the deceased" is confusing because it feels like it could go in many different directions.
  - The "What if VA needs more information?" question isn't needed because the fact that VA will contact the person if they need more information is obvious to most Veterans.  
  
### [Click Get Started]

* Is this what you expected to see?
  *  Yes.

### [clicks Continue], Chapter 1
* Can you explain what you are seeing now?
  *  Yes. Probably relationship to Servicemember would be sufficient.
  
* Do you understand how to answer all of the questions this screen asks?
  * No (see below).  
* Are you prepared to answer these questions?
  *  Yes.
* Is anything confusing or concerning to you?
  * What does "Other" mean? What other person would have the authority to make these decisions? Maybe a legal guardian.
   - Is "Name used during military service..." really necessary or would you use the name on their DD214? Would imagine it would be whatever name is on your DD214. Need clarification for this check box.
   - "VA claim number": Don't know where you would get that information.
   - "Place of Birth": Don't know what you want there because it's just left open. Would enter city, state. Maybe it's left open for people who were born overseas and VA would look information up to get clarification.
   - Other fields pretty straightforward.
  
### [clicks Continue], Chapter 2
* Can you explain what you are seeing now?
  * Yes.
* Do you understand how to answer all of the questions this screen asks?
  * No (see below).
* Are you prepared to answer these questions?
  * Yes.
* Is anything confusing or concerning to you?
  * - "Start of service period" and "End of service period" would need to be taken directly from the DD214. Not sure what the process would be if the person doesn't have access to their DD214. Would be preferable if people had a copy of the DD214 in front of them to get the information. Suggest including instructions around where to find service start and end date (ie, "From section 3B of your DD214") to help people find the date and make sure it's accurate.
  - Maybe a drop-down menu for "Highest rank attained."
  - Not sure what "Add another service period" pertains to. After clicking on it and getting the expanded copy: Seems like a duplication. Is this regarding people who've served in multiple branches? Only thing that possibly comes to mind. Suggest a little better clarification such as "If you've served in multiple branches, click here" or "If you have service in other branches, click here."
  
### [clicks Continue], Chapter 3 
* Can you explain what you are seeing now?
  * Yes. 
* Do you understand how to answer all of the questions this screen asks?
  * Yes, but not sure whether everyone would understand "Is there anyone currently buried..." question. That might need clarification. Same with "Your desired VA National Cemetery" if they didn't already have something picked out.
* Are you prepared to answer these questions?
  * Yes.
* Is anything confusing or concerning to you?
  * See above.

### [clicks Continue], Review

* Can you explain what you are seeing now?
  * Yes (overview of all information enter).
* Is anything confusing or concerning to you?
  * The certification statement is very long, but would probably just scan it and check the box. Usually just skim over these just to make sure not signing over rights. Don't really care about what specific federal statutes apply.
   
### [clicks Submit application], Submitted screen

* Can you explain what you are seeing now?
  * Yes.
* What happens next?
  * Would expect to be taken back to the section where it tells you the process. What else can there be? You just wait for your decision. You always have the phone number.
