## Introduction

Thank you for joining us today. My name is [name] and we also have a few colleagues observing and taking notes for this session. We are doing this website feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs working to build a new website that will help veterans get easier access to the benefits they deserve.

The team wants to evaluate a version of a website today. We want to see what works well, and what doesn’t work well. 
Some things we will show you might not work perfectly because they aren't final yet, so if you can tell us what you expect to 
do on each screen before you do it that will be helpful for us. We are especially insterested in places where you don't 
know what to do next or places that are confusing.

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work.

For the session, we aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and 
what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions 
so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

This entire feedback session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, 
so I may occasionally interrupt to keep us moving.

We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site which will help us capture everything you say accurately.
If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any 
way if we need to stop, and you will still recieve your $25 thank you.

As we're going through the session, I'd like you to think out loud while you are navigating the website. 
Saying things like I would click here next or I would want to go here first is very helpful for us.

Do you have any questions at this stage?

[The moderator will begin audio and screen recording, if using.]

## Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)

To start, I'd like to ask you a few warm-up questions.

Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?

Did you know that you could apply to be buried in a national cemetery at any time?

If so, how did you find out?

Do you know what qualifies you to be buried in a national cemetery?

Do you want to be buried in a national cemetery?

Have you applied already to be buried in a national cemetery? If so, could you describe how and your thoughts about it?

Okay, now I'm going to show you a website [pull up websites].
