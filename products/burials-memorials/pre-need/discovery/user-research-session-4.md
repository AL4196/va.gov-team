# Pre-Need User Research Session 4: Earl

## About Earl

* Was in the Coast Guard for about 20 years.
* Has lived in Hawaii since 1995. Did some service in Hawaii.


## Conversation Guide and Response

* Did you know that you could apply to be buried in a national cemetery at any time?
  * I believe so, but is there a specific national cemetery? There is a military cemetery here in Hawaii.
[more prompting] I’m not expecting to die anytime soon, but…do you have to apply well ahead of time or what?
  *[explanation]…I don’t think it matters. If I’m already dead, they can bury me at sea.

* Do you want to be buried in a national cemetery?
  * [no audible answer]
  
* Have you applied already to be buried in a national cemetery? If so, could you describe how and your thoughts about it?
  * No. 

### [Pre-Need mockup] https://marvelapp.com/i08i22g/
* Could you review this page and tell me what you think?
  *  A cellphone app for the VA.
  * [after prompting] You can find a national cemetery. 

* Is there anything that’s confusing for you?
  * [after more prompting] I don’t have a cell phone so I wouldn’t be looking at it on a cell phone. This would be on a webpage, right?
  * [yes]. It says “Respondent burden: 20 minutes.” No idea what that means.
  * “Expiration date” – so this page is only good through 11/30/2018 and then they’re going to put up another one?
  * “Respondent burden” maybe that means it’ll take me about 20 minutes.

*Is this clear to you that this is the first page of instructions to fill out an application?
  *Yeah, it’s got a “Continue” button. It’s basically an application. You can find a national cemetery.

* What would you do next?
  * If I was going to apply for one, I would go to the “Apply” budget where it says “Apply Online” [tries to click on the breadcrumb].
  * Or also at the bottom there was something that says “Continue”.
  
### [Click Get Started]

* Is this what you expected to see?
  * Yep.

### [clicks Continue], Chapter 1

* Can you explain what you are seeing now?
  * [no audible response]
  
* Do you understand how to answer all of the questions this screen asks?
  * Yes.
  
* Do you understand why you would add another applicant? Are you married?
  * No, and I don’t have any kids, so that wouldn’t apply.
  
### [clicks Continue], Chapter 2

* Can you explain what you are seeing now?
  * Yeah.
  
* Do you understand how to answer all of the questions this screen asks?
  * Yes. 

* Is anything confusing or concerning to you?
  * Nope.
  
### [clicks Continue], Chapter 3 

* Can you explain what you are seeing now?
  * [user reads form fields aloud as he reads through]
  
* Do you understand how to answer all of the questions this screen asks?
  * Yes.

* Do you have multiple service periods that you would use?
  * I did get out after doing 4 years, and went to college and then went back in. 
  *I was active reserve when I was in college, so it’s unbroken. So that would be confusing if it asked for a different service period.

* Is anything confusing or concerning to you?
  * [no audible response]

* What would you do next?
  * [no audible response; user clicks continue]

### [clicks Continue], Chapter 4

* Can you explain what you are seeing now?
  * [user reads questions and answers aloud]
  * It kind of doesn’t make sense to ask twice about which cemeteries. Why would you want to be buried in 2 different ones?

### [clicks Continue], Chapter 5, Certification

* Can you explain what you are seeing now? Is anything confusing or concerning to you?
  * So I guess if I scanned and emailed my documents, that would be acceptable?
  * [explanation] How do you upload them unless you scan them? Okay, you scan them and then upload them here. 
  * [goes through the steps without issue and clicks “continue”; goes through next steps and clicks “continue” without issue.]

### [clicks Continue], Review

* Can you explain what you are seeing now?
  * [user reads some forms aloud]
  * [user clicks around on screen] I can’t open any of these. [explanation]

* Do you understand what’s happening on the screen and what you’re supposed to do?
  * Yes.
  * You don’t have one of these things that allow you to make a signature online?
  * I just did one yesterday, but yeah, it says you’re signing for the applicant, I would think you would have the ability to do your signature. There’s an online company that does that and allows you to sign with your mouse in a pop-up.
  
### [clicks Submit application], Submitted screen

* What do you expect the download button would do?
  * Download a PDF.

* Would that be useful to you to be able to download a copy?
  * Yes. And then I’d assume you’d be able to print it out from the PDF.
  * [reads “Next steps”] I thought this step already happened? [in regards to “View instructions to mail or fax additional supporting documents.”] 
* So that would be confusing?
  * Yes.  
  
## Non-Task Related Comments

* Is there any feedback?
  * Everything seemed to work pretty well. Except this last part about mailing or faxing additional supporting documents. And as I said, the signature application would be useful to put in.

* What did you like most about this application?
  * The simplicity of applying.

* Do you think it was easier, harder, or about the same as filling out a paper form?
  * Definitely easier to fill it out here than to fill out regular paperwork. And here it says “Get help.” If I was filling out documents at hom, I’d have a lot 

* Do you know how you would call to find out more about your application or whether it was received?
  * There’s a phone number there. There’s a help desk.
  * Now, does this have an online help. If I clicked on the little help, would it start a chat session? 
  
* Is that what you would expect to see?
  * Well, most merchants have that. You click on help and a little help section pops up. Doesn’t always work that well because I’m a slow typist.

[Note: Applicant seems very interested in other forms, including mortgage applications, on Vets.gov.]

## Section 4
* 3 Top Takeaways
  * In general, the application is simple to use.
    But user appeared to want more retail-like experience (ie, online chat for support and ability to sign via mouse).
  * 3 places caused confusion:
    1) Adding another service period,
    2) Questions about preference for VA national cemetery
    3) Instructions about mailing/faxing documents on the confirmation screen.
  * 2 copy notes:
    1) "Respondent burden" was unclear at first. Consider replacing "20 minutes" with:
       "This application will take you about 20 minutes to fill out>"
    2) In instructions for mailing/faxing documents if user can't upload, add that user will get confirmation number
      upon submitting application.
  
* Any github issues you think we should log?
* Any helpdesk tickets you think we should submit?
