NCA has had a contract in place for nearly 6 years to optimize some of their transactions. The Digital Service will deliver these products to NCA, but in a different manner and timeline than they are laid out in current the contract. 

The work of the Digital Service for NCA will fall into three phases of work: 
1. Burial Schedule
2. Application Form (front-end) 
3. Automated Eligibility Determination

## PHASE 1. Burial Schedule (now-Memorial Day) 
A tool for the public to view the burial schedule of any cemetary managed by the VA. 

## PHASE 2. Application (June-Veteran's Day) 
An online application for burial benefits. While this will be initially targeted at pre-need customers, the same application can also theoretically be used for time-of-need. (It is the same application, but time-of-need takes priority over pre-need.)  

The application will be converted into HTML and collect data from applicants through form-fields on vets.gov. This is the simpliest way for Veterans to apply, as the only requirement is an internet connection. The vets.gov application will mirror the current paper form, and collect all the same data. While the Veteran will fill out what looks like form-fields on a website, the data collected will be packaged into a format that looks just like the paper application, so NCA employees can print it out and process it in the same manner as they would process an application arriving in the mail. 

This improves and centralizes the application process, but does NOT automate the eligibility determination. There is no back-end at this point. The application is simply a better user-interface, and connects to the existing manual back-office process. 

## PHASE 3. Automated Eligibility Determination 
A system that enables simple applications (making up about 80% of burial benefit applications) to obtain an automatic eligibility determination. 

In this phase we will move from a manual back-office process to automated eligibility for 80% of applications. The complicated 20% will still run through a manual process, but 80% will get a response immediately.
