## Overview
There are many VSP best-practice initiatives (code quality, testing methodologies and tools, accessibility, front-end and back-end architecture, security, privacy, etc...) that we would like a way to test and then demonstrate to new VSA teams onboarding on the VSP platform so it is easier and more clear for them observe. We will be selecting some different platform applications that we will then use for this effort going forward.

## Problem Statement
As a platform we need a way to demonstrate best practices, optimizations and tool usage in a real world production environment so VFS teams can better understand how they could utilize them in their own applications.
 
## User Goals
- As a VFS team member, I can see in code how the VSP best practices can be utilized to make an app better.
- As a VSP team member, I can best articlate the benefits and value of code optimizations and best practices through the implementation with an application.

## Business Goals

- There are examples to point to when we want to understand the impact of best practices and optimizations.
- Provides a way to define the value of an improvement.

## Assumptions
- Some ideas are hard to explain the value without showing an example.

## Questions

## Solution Approach

- Leverage the Health Care application (HCA) to use for demonstrating best practice, optimizations and tool benefits.
