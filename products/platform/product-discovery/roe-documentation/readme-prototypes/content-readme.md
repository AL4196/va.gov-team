### Project Kick-Off

It is beneficial to engage content as early as possible in your work so we can gather background information, understand scope, audience, and timing. Having us involved early will better inform the content review later on in the process.



------



### Phase 1: Discovery

#### Content Discovery Check-in

- The Content Team can review discussion guides and prototypes. We can also attend research sessions so that we better understand what areas your product might need extra content reviews or support for.

#### How to request a content discovery check-in

You can request a content discovery check-in in our Slack channel #vsp-content-ia



------



### Phase 2: Define/Design

#### Content review 

- If your project includes multiple content pages or complex content, please engage us as you begin to build out mockups and designs.

- Content will work closely with your design team to provide feedback on page flow and designs and prototypes.

#### What to Expect in a content review

[Voice](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles.html):  Does the content balance the voice between friendly and formal and sounds approachable and supportive? The VA.gov voice should be consistent across all our communications and is direct, transparent, dedicated, and human.

[Tone](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles.html): Does the content come across as harsh or intimidating? Even when discussing a serious topic, the tone should be gentle and compassionate. The tone may vary based on the material’s content, the context, and the reader’s likely emotional state.

 [Plain language best practices](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles.html): Is the content written in active voice and present tense? Ensure that the content isn’t too “wordy” or uses excessive modifying words (e.g, “really, completely, totally,” etc.)

 [Grammar and style guide check](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/): The review will also include a grammar check (look for typos, misspellings, and punctuation/spacing errors) and style guide check (ensure content adheres to the VA.gov style guide).**How to request a content review**See below for more info.



### Phase 3: Build

#### Content review 

Content should also review a product once it's on staging. This allows us to do a full E2E content review and a final proofread to ensure content recommendations we provided earlier in the process are accurate and correct. We'll also work closely with IA to ensure accurate page labels and placement.



#### How to request a content review

See below for more info.



## <a id="howtorequest"></a>How to request a content review 

Depending on the complexity and amount of content, content review will be completed **within 3 days**. More involved content reviews might take longer and due dates will be discussed at the time of request. 

You can request a content review several ways. 

A.  **If the content is short,** please add @peggygannon as a reviewer or assignee in the Zenhub issue or pull request in which the content appears.

B. **For more complex content reviews, e.g, E2E review of online applications, newly created pages, new tool launches,** please open a Zenhub issue in ```va.gov-team repo```. And, 

1. Choose standard issue template.
2. Title for the issue: ```Request Content review: [title of tool/app/page]```
3. Be sure to include the following in the issue:

**User story**

User story example: *As a member of a team building with or on VSP, I need to my content reviewed before [a usability session or product launch] to ensure it's accurate, aligns with VA style, and is error-free.*

**Goal**

 Please include:

*	The content. If short, drop the text directly into the issue. For longer content, you could include:
       * Word document, or
       * link to a high-fidelity prototype, or
       * link to the URL where the content appears on staging

*	Context. Provide a high-level description of where the content will appear. Is it part of a tool or static page that will support a tool? It's helpful to include screenshots of where the content will appear.
*	Launch date. Date you're targeting to launch your product.
*	Design elements to consider. This applies for content that isn't formatted yet. Will this content appear as a tooltip, alert box, error message, new application or tool?
*	User research. Is there any specific information from user research to take into consideration when doing the content review?

**Acceptance criteria**

If the content is part of an upcoming research session or product launch, list a timeframe for when this content should be reviewed.

Please also tag the issue with:

-	Milestone (when do you want this completed?)
-	Epic (what body of work is this a part of?)
-	Team/Practice Area label  ( ```content``` or ```content-ia-team```)
-	Label used by your team (for example, ```VAOS``` ```GI Bill Comparison Tool``` ```vsa-benefits-memorial```)
-	Assign issue to @peggygannon


4. Once the Content Review is finished the content editor will upload a list of content recommendations to the Zenhub issue. 
   If your team has questions (or disagrees with a requested change), use the Zenhub issue to discuss those questions.


5. A Content Review issue can be closed once all the content recommendations have been implemented and the inputs checked.
