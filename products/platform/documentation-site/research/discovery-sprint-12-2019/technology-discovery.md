 * Pros
   * Collaborate asynchronously with your team comment and review drafts before publishing.
   * Share your knowledge publicly or privately with anyone or use a secret link to allow non-GitBook users to access your private content.
   * Enjoy a living documentation thanks to an elegant WYSIWYG* editor, where you have both rich-content and rich-text.
   * Add value to your documentation by customizing your space to match your branding.
   * GitBook has multi-file drag and drop uploads. I tested with `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.gif`.
   * GitBook shows who made the last edit, and when.
   * GitBook supports comments from writers
   * I'm using an unauthenticated private window in another browser, and I can view my GitBook without logging in.
   * GitBook is free for open-source & non-profit teams
   * Search visually distinguishes between page names and page contents
   * Rich Embeds: Embed external web content: videos, code snippets and more

   * You can use Google Analytics to track your project's traffic and page views!
   * A bi-directional GitHub integration. The integration with GitHub is very easy to use: if you change your content on GitBook, your edits are pushed to a GitHub repository. Conversely, commits pushed to a GitHub repository are imported.
