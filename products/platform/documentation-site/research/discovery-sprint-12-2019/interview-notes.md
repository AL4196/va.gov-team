# Interview 1
- Date: 12/16/19
- Participant initials: VSP BE Tools team
- Participant role: VSP BE Tools team

### Notes:

#### As engineers, I'm willing to bet that y'all have been involved in creating or managing documentation or documentation tools before. Is that correct?
- *nods*
Creating ecosystems or wokring within various types of ecosystem
either
then sure

#### Talk me through a time when you’ve had a really successful experience with documentation. Anything that has been successful or seem to work in the past

K: Anecodel evidence I have in my career have had various experiences, using being part of shepherding good documentation as adeveloper. I have found that our approach of markdown docs or self organizing GH repositiory as incredibly flexible. I've woked that way in a smaller startup. I also used heavy dependencies such as confleunece, knowledge based type of things. Difficulty there is discoverability. yes or no format That realm can cause difficulties in discoverability

#### What info did that documentation provide? Was it just technical specs about APIs, was it "how-to" and onboarding, was it philosophical "why" documentation?
- I personaly mostly been involved in technical documentations. API docs and such not so much onboarding 

#### How did you know it was successful (or not)? What were the results? What behavior were you seeing to indicate that?
- Yeah one being in the negative, questions have to be reasked. I noticed that behavior happening when documentation isn't working. answers to questions exist in documentation. People answer the question in slack after having search and having not found it is detrimental. 

#### Measurments of success might be the oppositve of that. Can yo think of any other measurements that binds documentation?
This weekend I worked on a project, building out some things in terra form, resuing features i never used before. I spend quite a bit of time in their documentation. I wouldn't say success or faulture but I can say somethings i liked and didnt like. I was working through a new concept for me using the tool and i found places where they documentated 2 different components but never how they interacted. I had to experiment almost a hour, figuriing out how these 2 interplay. That was not great but I would say things I do like about their documentation, is if you know what you're looking for it's very easy to find it. If i know something I'm looking for i don't even have to search just the URL. I like that predicability it's been a long time since I didn't know the prdouct asa whole and their onboarding expereince

- Documentation...when I'm working with an isolated component but when I'm wokring on a project but having documentation on all how those things worke together. Reminds me of how muhc I miss not having documentation on depedent systems 

#### What tools and processes have you found effective in the past ensuring those stay up to date, designinating owners, or who is to keep developer docs up to date, anything that has worked?
- in the past and in this porejct, but from a bare tech level. API end point doc can be generated given the correct set of specifications we have a fiel for what the endpoints should respond with. We have a single sorurce of truth, that elimnates need to update doc in paralell. Thats on a bare level Ive done quite a bit, pretty standard process from the program specific. When working in code that spans more systems. it's much more benefit for the engineer for a narrator driven, outline, tutorial base, this is a recipe rather than those who have straight doc of this method. Maintaining that..Ive never found a good way to do that, but just manuallly. Doc first

- do you think it'd be accurate to specification vs. procedural

- perfect way to say it

- ive seen a blog post on why doc vs how doc. Why doesn't change very often but how changes a lot. lITERALLY just pointint to code so someone doesn't have to figure it out. 

- I think I know what blog post you're talkig about. is that the one recommending a FAQ channel

- Did you ever go hrough the FAQ channel

- I didn't get to go through that but liked the idea of the why vs how

- agreed

#### technical vs. non technical how do these things differ. on the line of why vs. how or different?
I think to me that's probably the line. I also found a lot of value in, when I first started the va.gov, there was a techical decisions folder whch helped some bg for what's going on. Those are super helpful for those decisions to be made in public and a stamp of approval

- I second that. the document decisions folder was imperative me for to understand the overall stuff 

#### Logistically, the why and the how, technical and nontechnical, if you wree looking for a decisions folder or documentat where would you expect or want to see one?

- In the code as comments, next to confusing methods. Beyond that, central. I don't want to go to 4 different journeys to find where that can be. Even if it's linking out from a central documenet. 



#### Was it paired with any tools or interaction? (Examples: search, sandbox, ability to contribute or ask questions) Did it look a certain way? Were there any other attributes that were particularly useful? What did those tools, interactions, or attributes allow you to accomplish?
- Worked ona script this weekend for fun and i used google developer apis for their sheets app. obviously google is the big player in the world, but they have some of the best api docs. but what really stands out is a slide out drawer, it's got 3 sections that you can send api requests live. Being able to add the doc site, test out the request, is a killer feature for a developer


#### Do you think that really applys to developer documentation or do you see parallels in nont tech doc?

- I can imagine them, but not really. I can come up with ideas all days

#### When you were using the sheets doc did you find everything you needed to but did you have to search elsewhere?

- So I found all atomic and linked. google is really good at that because they have an army of people to do it. They have tiers of documentation and tis looks back to scneairo based approach. they have a referece manual or samples but guides for getting started. Less of a devlper thing or how do we provide multiple facets to access this infomraton and perceive it


#### What would you say is your biggest pain point today with VSP documentation?
- I don't if this is the biggest but a big one for me is the duplication of content. We have taken on a number of issues to reorganize the repositiories and push them around, I went to update on how to respond to incidents docu. but I found 5 diff documentations to address the same exact thing. Someone took the old one, wrote a new one and didn't delete the old one. Theres a good deal of that which also leads it to be outdated. lots of outdated information and the reorg of the resource did not help but there's 100s and 1000s of dev links, 

#### Have you ever seen a standard who is responsible for keeping documentation up to date, or is that something that's not really done?

-  I think it's hard because the target is diferent at times a bit. there's product outlines, the tool that builds the feature for 3 months and we go build somethig else. people leave and then people don't know the structure of what's to date. I do't think Ive seen an attempt of something so far, but I think I'm just blidn to it

#### What are other pain points with VSP doc system?

LF. large files being uploaded, when teams need large files. since w erely on git we have a process with that, but getting sfiles over 25mb into doc. Uusually a sketch file or doc. separating design assets and docs, decisions, I will just thoughtof one. I'm a rails engineer and being pretty fmailar with rails doc. the process there since it's an open surce repositiroy anyone can contribute. 100s of thousands of devs can contribute back. in that regard, encouraging amendments if you think amendments is necessary. Headlining hey this is a team effort. ive seen that it works in the past in the right ecosystem

#### can you tell me a lot more about how that works and what it accomplishes

- docs are updated by those who you use it, in the trenches vs. in command. lends it self to more accuracy in granularity. It also proivides ownership and when you give owenership to your team, it helps with overall qality of work. we have so many users of docs.

- I'll say something, when we were transitioning vets. gov we went through a big doc push that had the idea of something good, but everything that just got transitioned to a new repo and links got broken. Here's a spreadsheet of everything, there's a storytelling aspect of it. a good encompassing view of what becomes products. I don't know who came up with that. As someone new coming on, that would be realy helpful, we only did it because the powers needed it but it got thrown away 

- I think it worked for me, because I was a new person and I got a deep dive about everything. everything was kinda linked to that one document and made it easy for someone to see. as someone in porduct, you can kinda deep dive into it. It also had the owners too, so it had more technical questions 

- I agree that was a uuseful thing to go down the bullet list, this is how I use things. I'm interested in bill have you encountered any of that doc? as you were onvoarding

- I think thebiggest thing, is I realize with vets website, I ahd trobule getting it to build. I needed vets content as well getting it a sibling to make it work 

#### For context, I think what TJ was talking about was the transtiion readiness factor. kinda a table of contents situation

- This was done out of requirements, people kinda suffered to a degree because this was a mandatory thing and i do think we got a lot from this but it disappeared to my knowledge. 

- I know culturally K said, giving people ownership, this seems the oppsote of that

- I thinkt his was a handoff methods. I do recall a lot of...maybe not suffering, but a flurry activity in the last couple sprints. I think that they're...the opnion is not warranted.


#### If you’re directing a VFS team member to information related to their job, where do you go to find it/where do you tell them to go?
- the VAGOV repo, specifically the engineering subsection on their particular role. Generall y I found good success in that repo now. I've directed her to that repo with success. as a BE engineer we spend a good amount of time in the devops folders. It sort of has a source of truth for things, I think that doc should exist in devops for several reasons. 

- Yeah I tried to put..are we talking about onboarding. 

- new VFS member asking you about backend or ops doc. Where are you going to direct them? maybe the answre is nowehre?

- I think that its about what they're asking about. We're in vets gov, now in va gov. depending on the level that they're at that's a good one. if they're wondering about ops in gerneal. there's a va gov team repo. 

#### Do you see yourselves as responsible for keeping any of the above information up to date? How do you ensure that it is accurate?
- yeah I prersnally wouldn be rsponsible the genreal policies and norms. We'd be repsonseible for BE tools folder, maybe the onboarding expiernee for VAgov. Devops repo I would refer to ops person. They would have to merge the change i think 

#### What about *name or name* do you see yourselves repsonsible?

- I'm prob the wrong person to ask becase I get myself in everyhtig

- there's certain documentation to keep up to date that falls on our tea? there's blurry lines on what falls in infrastrcuture, and what can't be touches by backend, there's prob some stuff that's more in our plate. 

- If you saw a document that is out of date, how would you determine who should update that document?
i dont know

- I guess it kind depends, that i know endough to know that it's wrong, but I'll try to correct it in a pull request and hwo might know more about that. we do't have an owener of docs

- i look at the git blame. Kid of like throwing into a wishing well. I'd update it if it needs an update. see who's responsible r mght know about this if there's no clear answer




#### What would you expect see on a successful VSP documentation site?
- I would expect to see, putting my hat as new person, i'd understand the documentation right away. it should be intuitive enough so that id' be able to navigate it. new person would come in saying, ok i can figure this out. At least find where things are at. 

- Any other things? whether that's any ifno or tools/features to be expecting?

- this is maybe a left outfield pitch? cant find what i'm looking for maybe a chat button, or send you directly to slack. That way we can capture that lack of success somehow. Automatiable and you can click a button on what im looking for and be able to write a little on what im trying to find

- specific changer on uses can be useful. Checking on links. doesn't help we have 3 different repos thatit can be and other repos that it can be in. Basic sanity checkin might be useful. 

#### Going off on these features and tools? either something youve contributed to or just used What tools or processes have experience using contributing to? Have you used any in terms of contributing or using that worked or didn't

- I'll profess my love for gitbook till the days end. right now it provides a world calss platform for collaborating. you still have to organize the contetn on archtiectue that makes sense. Not adding overhead that unnecessary I like gitbook a lot. I'd like to investigate more on stack overflow for teams

- have any of ya'll used postman collection?

- yes super helful for devs absolutely. can hearkedn back about speccificaitons we've heard earlier. 

 - I've used gitbook for my personal knowledge wiki but not in a professional environemnt. 

- Any other tools or platforms anyone used?

- Not so much backend side but I've used storybook for FE code. 

- I got mixed reviews on storybook from a remote FE in a react-y world. Esp when a lot of react is optomization. Very much allows you to click the prototype 

- one thing I really enjoy is when people tie in codepends to their documentation. side by side you have actual code running in browser of documentation

- the materual UI react library 

- to add to that, there's something like jupiter notebooks but it's inlining running the code in the doc. acts like a scratch pad. If you're talking about more of an onboarding or technical perspective. Inline code or scratch pads are awesome

- I have one question that i forgot to ask that we were just chatting about as a team, where is the docs know for vets api?

- I know lighthouse team is devlopers va gov

- No, that's sort of separate. We have swagger docs and should be accessible and link. last time I checked it was broken though, developers can handle locally. beyond that the readme in the reposiitory is prob the best doc beyond the code. I velieve that's the case. I think that covers our corners

- Using something like swagger, code having document vs writing it yourself is something to think about. 

- What do you mean by self document?I always get weary when I hear the term

- essentially willt ap into api endpoints based on model of endpoints. Actually generating the etnire webiste, url swagger, test and run things. you dont have to worry about building and maintainng

- this is something we tosed around before to, making sure our API isOAS3, compliant that way we have a suite of tools. We can test, mock servers. Work might be underway in some way or the other 

#### Why do you get wary when you hear the phrase self documenting code?

- Well, idk, it's a kinda like "read the source code dummy" A lot of times i hear it, well go read the soruce code it'll be obvious what it does. that's so not the case, people don't know whatthat hting is. In this case it is awesome but is it as self documenting as you think it is. Writing why docs is not something automated. Oh it's self documented so that's good

- if documenation is includedin well written code, that would be why doc not how doc

- if you're writing doc in code, is doc, not self doc. 

#### does anyone think that works or doesn't work well writen code? would you need spearate doc

- if I don't know language, i could get caught on some things. there's certainly a balance, Comments are necessary when codeis absoutley on baseline level. Comments are part of self documenting code. Codelines tell you what you do. Then there'd be writing english and we don't need code programmers.
