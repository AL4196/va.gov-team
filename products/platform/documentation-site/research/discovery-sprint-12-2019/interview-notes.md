- Participant initials: BR
- Participant role: Product Manager

### Notes:

#### Talk me through a time when you’ve had a really successful experience with documentation.
- 

#### What info did that documentation provide? Was it just technical specs about APIs, was it "how-to" and onboarding, was it philosophical "why" documentation?
- 

#### How did you know it was successful (or not)? What were the results? What behavior were you seeing to indicate that?
- 

#### What tools and processes have you found effective in the past?
- 

#### What tools and processes have you found ineffective in the past?
- 

#### What processes did you use to set standards across different teams who were contributing to the documentation?
- 

#### How did you ensure that the information stayed up to date?
- 

#### What do you think VSP, the platform team, can learn from this example?
- 

#### If you had the chance to create that ecosystem again, what would you do differently?
- 

#### If you had to choose 3 things that you think were critical to your success, what would you say those were?
- 

#### In what ways do you think engineering documentation differs from non-technical documentation? Where is there overlap in the problem space? Where do they diverge?
- 

#### Talk me through a time when you've had a really successful experience using documentation to get something done.
- 

#### What info did that documentation provide? Was it just technical specs about APIs, was it "how-to" and onboarding, was it philosophical "why" documentation?
- 

#### Was it paired with any tools or interaction? (Examples: search, sandbox, ability to contribute or ask questions) Did it look a certain way? Were there any other attributes that were particularly useful? What did those tools, interactions, or attributes allow you to accomplish?
- 

#### Did you rely solely on those docs, or did you use that and also fill in gaps by asking a bunch of questions elsewhere or using another method?
- 

#### What would you say is your biggest pain point today with VSP documentation?
- 

#### If you’re looking for information related to how to do your job, where do you go to find it?
- 

#### If you’re directing a VFS team member to information related to their job, where do you go to find it/where do you tell them to go?
- 

#### Do you see yourselves as responsible for keeping any of the above information up to date? How do you ensure that it is accurate?
- 

#### What would you expect see on a successful VSP documentation site?
-
