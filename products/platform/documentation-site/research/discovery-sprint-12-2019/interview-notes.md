# Interview 3
- Date: 12/17/19
- Participant Initials: KW
- Participant Role: Drupal developer

### Notes

#### Before we get into the specifics of using Drupal for documentation, I'd like to talk a bit about your experience with documentation in general. Have you ever created documentation or contributed to documentation before for others to use?
Yes.

#### [If yes] What info did that documentation provide? Was it just technical specs about APIs, was it "how-to" and onboarding, was it philosophical "why" documentation?
I've done documentation for every project I've been involved in. It's been everything from writing comments in code to information for other team members to information for people who are installing the product for the first time, for users, everything. 

User research kinds of stuff as well. I like the format that VA use for that. Project documentation, historical, so that people don't have to come and do too much archaeology to figure out why things are the way they are.

#### Was this documentation that you contributed to "good"? How did you know it was good or bad? What made it successful (or not)? What were the results? What behavior were you seeing to indicate that?
Sometimes, sometimes it was horrible! If people aren't asking me questions directly via email or Slack, that's how I know it's good. On some documentation, for example at my company's handbook we have Google Analytics. THat doesn't necessarily tell us if it's good or not, it just tells us if it's popular. Honestly I've never spent that much time with metrics for documentation, but it could be good to do. 

#### What tools and processes have you found effective in the past?
One thing that's really useful is changelogs. That can take lots of different forms. For example, in my company's documentation we have pull requests — everyone sees that. THat's not very loud. But when something gets merged in, there's a log that goes out to the team to say "here's what's changed in the company handbook this week." Let robots do the heavy lifting there but make sure it's not too much noise for people. 

How to organize it is the biggest challege - hierarchy. I know there's a lot of work that's been done on VA stuff recently, I havent' followed it that closely. Theres just a lot of hard problems to solve. It has to be done well bc if it's not, if the IA isnt right, then no one can find anything. 

Short pages, I like short pages. The people who are writing documentation for the CMS, I'd rather have shorter pages. 

Search is the other things.

For our company handbook, we use GitHub and then it's all published in Read the Docs. For me that's hard bc it emphasizes these really long pages. I get lost. I'd rather have shorter ones.

#### What tools and processes have you found ineffective in the past?

I don't know why, but our team, the CMS team, started using Jira and Confluence. I found COnfluence OK at first, but it felt far away from everything after a while. And then the chagelogs were not very useful or central bc of all the noise within Jira and COnfluence. no one knew what was chanigng. So I don't think I'm a big fan of COnfluence any more. I also think openness is great, which is one of the best things about anything git-related. 

Having documentation as close as possible to the context in which people are working is great. For CMS documentation, it makes sense to have documentation in the CMS. Then we can do things like pull content in the CMS ... it's in a database ... we can pull things around into different places. It's a bit more dynamic, we can structure it in different places and reuse it, which it harder to do in the Git Pages world. Both from a documentation maintaining perspective and I think for consumption, having it as close as possible to where you're working helps ensure that it's maintained more and read more. 

#### Were there different teams contributing to the documentation? If so, what processes did you use to set standards across different teams?

As of now, not for the CMS documentation. We try to refer out to the style guide wherever we can. In code, where you've got code commenting, in the CMS we want to have the documentation live as close as possile to where content editors are working. If you're editing a certain field we want to have certain help text. That's a type of documentation that's as close as possible to where someone's doing the work. In those places we also refer out to the content style guide and the design system as much as we can. Just remembering what is the concern for the CMS and what's the broader concern.

#### How did you ensure that the information stayed up to date?

We assign someone to be responsible for making sure it's up to date, it's in their job description and we can hold them accountable to it. THe other thing I'd like to do more of is build it into our release management sort of stuff. So that at the end of the sprint or whenever a release happens, one of the acceptance criteria is for everything in that repo there's a documentation criteria for this. Just reinforcing that things need to get updated. 

The other thing is documentation sprints now and then. There's a documentation debt and maybe even we could track that as its own component in our ... if it's an issue, an issue label. And then now and then, every few sprints, take a pause and make sure it's all up to date. 

#### What do you think we can learn from this example?

I don't think we're doing it right right now. We - CMS team - have a week left on our contract and there's a big push to move things out of COnfluence. We're doing stuf fbut it's not going to be ther right way. I can't point to any specific things. 

Mikki — When you say, we're not doing things right, what do you mean? 

K - The way we've written documentation specifically, it's not great yet. We're maintaining a product that's going to be used by a lot of different teams. IT's got a lot of different products within it. I would like to see us write our documentation more from a product perspective ("this product is designed to do this, this is why"). With the overall purpose. RIght now our documentation is currently very technical "in order to do this, do this and this and this." 

It misses the big picture a bit, it misses the forest for the trees. Trying to write higher level prodcut descriptions in a user story way ... we should write it as if we're selling the product, to remind users why they're doing things. We also need to address the decisions that are baked into the product. Sometimes we've made decisions that privilege the end users over the editors. I'd like the opportunity to explain that — we've made this decision to support this for end users, that's why editors need to deal with this weird feature. 

For example, FAQs in drupal. THe editing experience for them is kind of annoying, but we've done that bc we want a really amazing schema and markup on the front end. We've structured certain content in certain ways in order to make it easier for VVeterans to get their benefits, and in order to edit those there's lots of different fields to fill out. 

ALso, more videos! Short videos. I think our documentation is really different than the documentation VPS is doing. Platform is doing documentation for other engineers, we're doing documentation for content editors.

Loom as a video service, or GIFs. A 10 second GIF can sometimes accomplish more than 3-4 paragraphs of texxt.

#### If you had the chance to work in that ecosystem again, what would you do differently?

#### Thinking beyond documentation that you've contributed to, have you ever used documetation that you thought was really good?

I think so, yes.

#### What info did that documentation provide?

Onboarding at VA is a real PITA. There's certain documentation that helped and some that was really bad. 

The SOCKS proxy was good in places. IT's an alternative to CAG, and CAG sucks. You're not using your native OS, etc. A lot of us have used the SOCKS proxy documentation, which I'm pretty sure is in the platform team's area. SOme of it is great and some of it is less great. IT's written for a specific audience, and now other audiences are trying to use it. 

It had lots of numbered steps, that was good. Good formatting. As a developer, code blocks are really good. Bash commands that I can copy/paste into my terminal that explain what they do ... and maybe they even do 10 or 15 commands at once. 

Short pages are good and strucured headings, all of that stuff, etc. With tabels of contents that provide jump links if it does get too long. I like GIFs and I like videos as long as they're short. I like to know why I'm doing something. 

#### Was it paired with any tools or interaction? (Examples: search, sandbox, ability to contribute or ask questions) Did it look a certain way? Were there any other attributes that were particularly useful? What did those tools, interactions, or attributes allow you to accomplish?

#### Did you rely solely on those docs, or did you use that and also fill in gaps by asking a bunch of questions elsewhere or using another method?

I think for example with the SOCKS proxy, it didn't all apply to our team. You had to do a few steps, get approval, and do a few more steps. You had to make a merge request with ... your SSH key or something. I think our team developed our own way of interpreting it. We had a Slack post that was like "you have to do this part of it and then this". We had our own documentation for the documentatino. Ideally, you don't want that. 

I wonder if there had been a message at the bottom that said "hey can you help us improve this documentation?" I bet one of us would have done this. That's a good thing to provide reminders and prompts about how can we improve this. 

WIth GItHub, a lto of people aren't super familiar with editing markdown. There hsould be different ways for people to contribute. I don't think most people are ... especially if it's not your documentation, people don't feel comfporatable just editing themarkdown and creating a merge request. 

#### [If Drupal was not discussed] OK, great! Thanks for that information. Now, it is my understanding that you wanted to talk a bit about Drupal as a technical solution for documentation. Can you tell us more about that?

They've been working on it in the last couple days, I've been out, so I don't know what state it's in ... [troubleshooting Internet problems]. 

This could be published on VA. gov in the future

THe content viewing experience in Drupal has never been very good. THere's a lot more work to do to make this ... for example, Q/As, they have a label question and then ... 

[Go to benefit hub to FAQ] A lot of this is structured in Q/A. FAQ can be structured as accordians or not accordians. Our ediitng experience in Drupal, you can have WYSIWYG blogs or you can have Q/As. We can reuse some of these formats in our documentation as well. So a process list can be used for the documentation. So I'll show you the other content blocks ... these are the ones we've enabled so far. We can expand this to include videos, table of contents. When you're editing a piece, this is potentially nice ... 

We don't have a documentation user role yet. Once nice thing, I think, about editing a menu in Drupal vs in Github is you can move things around pretty quickly. You can add new pages, while you're adding a page you can put it anywhere, but after that you can move it around. 

Right now the menu is collapsed. Potentially this would be multiple documentation homes. In the future, it would be cool if we were using the front end sidebar approach when you're in drupal. 

The change management is not the same as GitHub. This is an empty README. In GItHub you have to add a readme for a directory to eist, so ppl just have empty readmes usually. When I created this early on it was just a proof of concept, it just has lorem ipsum in it and stuff. WHen you edit it, say I wanted to move this image ... it's currently in draft, it's rare that we would have draft documentation pages. Well, it will happen. For example for VAMC - soon there will be, say, 500 VAMC editors. If we're going to make a change in the CMS we can save those as a draft and then once the code goes live we can publish the new documentation. IT's not quite as ... if you're a developer and you're used to the vagov-content "CMS" they were used to editing in branches and editing 20 pages at once. This can't do that as much, you can still do bulk changes though. Hopefully for documentation that wouldn't be as big of a deal. 

The infrastructure is there to push this to VA.gov, but currently this documentation will just be served in Drupal. At the very least we could preview, but it wouldn't be a big lift to put this on the front end. We could add any of our existing content types to the documentation. Including downloads.

MK — I've read that tools like gatsby can render content from drupal, have you ever heard anything like that? 

Gatsby is a popular way to do decoupled durpal pages. For this it would kind of be reinventing the wheel. For something like this, there probably wouldn't be a huge advantage to using gatsby, just using our existing front end seems natural. 

#### What outcomes does Drupal support?



#### Have you ever used VSP - the platform team's - documentation?

### Notes:

#### Talk me through a time when you’ve had a really good experience with documentation.
- Rf - Reacts doc is really good, easy to find, well indexed, follows domain language consistently
- What made it successful
- Rf - Searchability of it, full featured search
- Experience with bad documentation
- Rf - the worst doc is missing doc, and that's a problem on vsp a lot is being able to find the most up to date or even to know it exists…

#### What info did that documentation provide? Was it just technical specs about APIs, was it "how-to" and onboarding, was it philosophical "why" documentation?

#### How did you know it was successful (or not)? What were the results? What behavior were you seeing to indicate that?

#### What tools and processes have you found effective in the past?
- Rf - no, never been part of good doc culture, I've read about other companies that have good doc culture like gitlab, I think it sounds cool but I don't know how to get to that level of discipline

#### What tools and processes have you found ineffective in the past?
- Rf wikis don't work, because there's no central governance, there's no editor, when you don't have consistent editors you get diff dialects…in a larger org its important to have the same domain language across, because it gets very confusing…if its not being reviewed or having any controls over it

#### What processes did you use to set standards across different teams who were contributing to the documentation?
- Rf we didn't …the gatsby site is the offer of 3 people pulling together and coalesce it into one voice over 3 months

#### How did you ensure that the information stayed up to date?
- Rf we didn't [laughs]

#### What do you think VSP, the platform team, can learn from this example?
- Rf our priority was to get as much doc done as possible, so tradeoffs we didn't build the infrastructure to maintain…its easy to make but hard to publish…being able to see the changes updated on the doc site is important…if they don't see the updates quickly it removes the incentive

#### If you had the chance to create that ecosystem again, what would you do differently?
- Rf would have looked at 3rd party tools, could have used that instead of building something ourselves…(megan: is there any in particular?)…there's a pm doc management tool, we didn't evaluate any tools, I know they're out there, not a big fan of confluence, I know it could work, it didn't work where I used it before…the search tool is a plug in…algolia
- Br the tool was notion.io, notion is pretty dope…it’s a productivity tool does a little bit of everything, project, product, documentation a little bit of everything
- Megan: I'm surprised you wanted to look at other tools…my understanding is that gatsby can render md files and tech doc can live close to the code, thought that's where gatsby would have advantage
	• Rf yeah that was one of our goals - to pull doc out of multiple repos - one idea is that you could put a readme on an app and then pull that out and put it on the documentation site…so if we want to update it its in proximity of the code…we didn't finish it, the doc update process is broken, so if we fixed it that would be great…once we had to move on to higher proprieties there's no one to fix it…if its 3rd party you have a whole company that can fix it…after the infrastructure was done, dev was moved off to work on other things and now it’s a prioritization exercise
	• Br - its not only the upkeep, it’s the type of resource…it’s a developer needed not a non-technical person
	• Rf - it might be that we hve an overly complicated set up and maybe we should stick to the standard set up and not use plugins…simplify the approach…use default gatsby install

#### If you had to choose 3 things that you think were critical to your success, what would you say those were?

#### Talk me through a time when you've had a really successful experience using documentation to get something done.
- Cv - end of last week, trying to comb through 17 mill json files using jq, going to their documentation, they have all the things you can do with examples for each, so that was nice

#### What info did that documentation provide? Was it just technical specs about APIs, was it "how-to" and onboarding, was it philosophical "why" documentation?
- Cv - it was technical…you feed it a bunch of commands, it had all the commands, description of each one, how you would use each one in put and output
- Bf - do you feel like you learn about new stuff from documentation, or use it as a reference if you already know 
- Cv - I did learn new stuff when I was looking at that one,…I don't know, maybe not typically…what I was trying wasn't working so I was poking around how I might else solve this problem
- Rf- if I need something as a reference, I use google and hit mdn
- Cv - I use mdn but I never use their search, I use google
- Bf - don’t' think I would even browse on mdn
- Cv that works great for them because they are like the first or second hit…but…

#### Was it paired with any tools or interaction? (Examples: search, sandbox, ability to contribute or ask questions) Did it look a certain way? Were there any other attributes that were particularly useful? What did those tools, interactions, or attributes allow you to accomplish?

#### Did you rely solely on those docs, or did you use that and also fill in gaps by asking a bunch of questions elsewhere or using another method?

#### What would you say is your biggest pain point today with VSP documentation?
- Cv - no idea what's there, if someone asked me a question…
- Rf - we don't have a good documentation culture and we keep a lot of stuff in our heads and in slack…end up having the same convo multiple times because we don't document…the doc we do have its inconsistent voice, its hard to scan to find info you need…sometimes there's just blocks of text and you have to stop everything…its not easy to read
- Megan: talk a bit more about documentation culture…what do you think characteristics make up a strong culture
- Rf - primarily communication things through documentation…we are more socially oriented where we communicate through conversations through slack and use documentation as kind of a h elper…someone asked me for help in stalling site rather than using documentation and updating it, we had conversation and I should update it…but yeah
- Megan: why the slack call?
- Rf- the slack call was to identify that it was inaccurate, now I need to update it, but that's like a multi-step process…I have to go to the file, write it out, validate, go through approval process where someone else has to review…it’s a multiple step process…I have other things to work on…I guess I should make it a priority and set an example….that's on the gatsby website
- Megan: if you were - can you think of any other things that would help you prioritize
- Rf - if I could go and annotate documentation and then go back, then I could go through it when I had time…some feedback loop..
- Megan: do you feel you have time to do that
- Rf- probably not…even if I had a list of things that were outdated I personally wouldn't have time…it would take some time to write up…there are other things that are higher priority 
- Megan: how might we fix that
- Rf - never communicate over slack, if its important enough to explain, stop the convo and document…if that's too rigid find a middle ground
- Cv - if we went that approach we would need to make it lower overhead to make those changes…I may have updated the doc once upon a time but I couldn't tell you how to do it now
Ds - which area is this documentation around
- Cv - I've updated the readme, but maybe I've updated the gatsby site but I don't remember how
- Rf - I know I said I don't like wikis but I do like the interactions of a wiki…be able to edit right on the page
- Megan: what other the barriers (besides not knowing how, taking time)
- Cv there are a few hurdles, first I need to find do we have this doc, is it up to date, how is it not up to date, how can I fix it in a voice consistent with everything else, how do I fix it…there's a lot to go through rather than just answer the question
- Megan - if you don't, who should update the doc
- Cv I think especially for things like…yeah, exactly…I think it depends on the kind of documentation, if it’s the onboarding process we leave it to the team, if its technical  docu of a thing I built, then its me, if I'm adding a feature than I should add the documentation to include that thing…I guess if I know how to update then it should be responsibility to at least flag someone down…I'm in the middle of doing something completely different, someone asks something out out of the blue, should I spend an hour updating the documentation or continue what I'm doing…depends on what needs to be updated and when

#### If you’re looking for information related to how to do your job, where do you go to find it?
- Rf slack…
- Do you search in slack?  Rf - yeah…that's how I remember that someone explained that to me months ago…I use dm to index lots of information…I don't encourage that but that's the way I've been doing it for now
- Cv - it depends on what part of my job…I often search slack…I think my trouble is I just have a bunch of stuff in my head and I kind of remember what it was before we had documentation so that's what I fall back to…when we first stated the whole platform and we had documentation around the like PRs…someone was looking for it and its not there anymore because it was updated…I do search github but mostly I fall back on memory
- Rf - I very often go to the old team repo…I probably use the old one more than the new, because sometimes stuff has not migrated over or its in the state that I rmeember it was in more consistently….I found it one way before so I know that I can find it that way in that repo…the new one I don’t search for it, I navigate the director structure…often it works if I know something is there

#### If you’re directing a VFS team member to information related to their job, where do you go to find it/where do you tell them to go?
- Rf - I'll tell them to go to the new team repo if it’s a doc that I know is there…sometimes to the client document repo because its better than what's inside the new repo…I'm not familiar with the new team repo…I don't know where the docs are and what state they are in…
- 

#### Do you see yourselves as responsible for keeping any of the above information up to date? How do you ensure that it is accurate?
What would you expect see on a successful VSP documentation site?
- Cv - lots of words
- Rf - search and code examples and diagrams

#### Other questions
- Megan: can technical and non-technical documentation can live together well, or what are the differences and overlaps
- Rf- probably not…it depends on the volume and how we do the indexing…we tried that and people were putting meeting notes in the repo and it killed the indexing and you couldn't find anything…also not sure what an example of non-technical documentation is (megan: things like IA best practices, SEO best practices, design comps, content, etc)
- Rf - I would say probably not…again it depends on how we can search through that…as an engineer I would not want ux design and copy results showing up in my results…just as if you were a content writer you wouldn't want to see 
- Cv - when we are looking in the documentation for a thing we know what kind of thing it is…when we are searching for one everything else kinda doesn't matter…siloing them out would be fine and may lead to a better user experience…gatsby for example could have menus with different categories that are specific to the kind of thing you are looking for
- Megan: have you encountered any tools that provide a hybrid of functionality that they can render md files near the code but also the hosting platform benefits…or is something else more important
- Cv - I got nothing
- Megan: that's fair
- Crystabel: any other questions
- Bf: how much should we rely on the code to be self documenting
- Rf - self documenting code, sure you can have micro level…we don't have a lot of that…what people need is a higher level understanding of the app…I don't know how we could do that with just the code…example, apple ios doc is a good example where if you have a component they will list all the common ways to compose…looking to solve a problem, not 
- Specification doc versus procedure docs
- Rf - [nods]
- Megan: if you were looking for documentation for a specific product or template, where would you find that …agile 5 metalsmith templates for example…do we think that vfs teams are documenting their prod
- Rf - maybe on the back end but I don't think on the front end…definitely not on the front end because I've had to maintain a lot of these apps and none of them have documentation for fe
- Megan: should we?
- Rf - my understanding is that we have swagger for be, I don't know where those are
- Megan - [hypothetical pr scenario] how does this need to have more info in pr requests might play into documentation for context
- Cv - looking for what's the purpose of the pr, I can see the code is fine but why is it here…if the pr description is blank I'm not going to go hunting for it…this needs to be done, great, why though…that's where I've been most opinionated…documenting decisions, there's probably a balance there, we probably don't need documentation for every pr, but for the general approach…
- Megan: what level of granularity would we expect to see on technical documentation, also my assumption is that any project will have weird decisions made…do you all encounter that engineers 
- Rf - usually I document decisions if something is contentions, that's a good litmus test…the other thing if a lot of useful research is done, then I'll try and encourage people to extract that and document that because it could be 40 hrs of work and I don't want to lose that…
- Cv - I think technology decisions fall into that as well…for example, I have no idea we are still using metalsmith
- Megan: have you encountered here or anywhere else standards for what level/point of things that should be documented
- Rf: sent link https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/documentation-guide/documentation-style-guide
- Megan: doesn't talk about when to document things
- Rf - we just didn't get to it…most of our effort was spent on effort…there's a lot of different approaches to how people write, some people write very flowery which I hate its hard to read and scan…maybe we can teach people how to write

- Bf -  how often do you use tests as source of documentation
- Rf - never
- Cv - I never look at the tests, if I need to know how a thing works because its not a guarantee that all the functionality is tested
Rf - usually tests as documentation only work when you have a good, strong unified engineering culture…we have 1/2 doz diff javascript dialects, you never know what you're gonna get into

- Participant role: VSP BE Tools team

### Notes:

#### As engineers, I'm willing to bet that y'all have been involved in creating or managing documentation or documentation tools before. Is that correct?
- *nods*
Creating ecosystems or working within various types of ecosystem?
either
then sure

#### Talk me through a time when you’ve had a really successful experience with documentation. Anything that has been successful or seem to work in the past

K: Anecodel evidence I have in my career have had various experiences, using being part of shepherding good documentation as adeveloper. I have found that our approach of markdown docs or self organizing GH repositiory as incredibly flexible. I've woked that way in a smaller startup. I also used heavy dependencies such as confleunece, knowledge based type of things. Difficulty there is discoverability. If you don't phrase things in yes or no format That can cause difficulties in discoverability

#### What info did that documentation provide? Was it just technical specs about APIs, was it "how-to" and onboarding, was it philosophical "why" documentation?
- I personally mostly been involved in technical documentation. API docs and such, not so much onboarding 

#### How did you know it was successful (or not)? What were the results? What behavior were you seeing to indicate that?
- Yeah one being in the negative, questions have to be re-asked. I noticed that behavior happening when documentation isn't working. answers to questions exist in documentation. People answer the question in slack after having search and having not found it is detrimental. 

#### Measurments of success might be the oppositve of that. Can yo think of any other measurements that binds documentation?
This weekend I worked on a project, building out some things in terra form, reusing features i never used before. I spend quite a bit of time in their documentation. I wouldn't say success or faulture but I can say somethings i liked and didnt like. I was working through a new concept for me using the tool and i found places where they documentated 2 different components but never how they interacted. I had to experiment almost a hour, figuriing out how these 2 interplay. That was not great but I would say things I do like about their documentation, is if you know what you're looking for it's very easy to find it. If i know something I'm looking for i don't even have to search just the URL. I like that predicability it's been a long time since I didn't know the prdouct as a whole and their onboarding expereince

- Documentation...when I'm working with an isolated component but when I'm wokring on a project but having documentation on all how those things worke together. Reminds me of how muhc I miss not having documentation on depedent systems 

#### What tools and processes have you found effective in the past ensuring those stay up to date, designinating owners, or who is to keep developer docs up to date, anything that has worked?
- in the past and in this porejct, but from a bare tech level. API end point doc can be generated given the correct set of specifications we have a fiel for what the endpoints should respond with. We have a single sorurce of truth, that elimnates need to update doc in paralell. Thats on a bare level Ive done quite a bit, pretty standard process from the program specific. When working in code that spans more systems. it's much more benefit for the engineer for a narrator driven, outline, tutorial base, this is a recipe rather than those who have straight doc of this method. Maintaining that..Ive never found a good way to do that, but just manuallly. Doc first

- do you think it'd be accurate to specification vs. procedural

- perfect way to say it

- ive seen a blog post on why doc vs how doc. Why doesn't change very often but how changes a lot. lITERALLY just pointint to code so someone doesn't have to figure it out. 

- I think I know what blog post you're talkig about. is that the one recommending a FAQ channel

- Did you ever go through the FAQ channel

- I didn't get to go through that but liked the idea of the why vs how

- agreed

#### technical vs. non technical how do these things differ. on the line of why vs. how or different?
I think to me that's probably the line. I also found a lot of value in, when I first started the va.gov, there was a techical decisions folder whch helped some bg for what's going on. Those are super helpful for those decisions to be made in public and a stamp of approval

- I second that. the document decisions folder was imperative for me to understand the overall stuff 

#### Logistically, the why and the how, technical and nontechnical, if you wree looking for a decisions folder or documentat where would you expect or want to see one?

- In the code as comments, next to confusing methods. Beyond that, central. I don't want to go to 4 different journeys to find where that can be. Even if it's linking out from a central documenet. 



#### Was it paired with any tools or interaction? (Examples: search, sandbox, ability to contribute or ask questions) Did it look a certain way? Were there any other attributes that were particularly useful? What did those tools, interactions, or attributes allow you to accomplish?
- Worked ona script this weekend for fun and i used google developer apis for their sheets app. obviously google is the big player in the world, but they have some of the best api docs. but what really stands out is a slide out drawer, it's got 3 sections that you can send api requests live. Being able to add the doc site, test out the request, is a killer feature for a developer


#### Do you think that really applys to developer documentation or do you see parallels in nont tech doc?

- I can imagine them, but not really. I can come up with ideas all days

#### When you were using the sheets doc did you find everything you needed to but did you have to search elsewhere?

- So I found all atomic and linked. google is really good at that because they have an army of people to do it. They have tiers of documentation and tis looks back to scneairo based approach. they have a referece manual or samples but guides for getting started. Less of a devlper thing or how do we provide multiple facets to access this infomraton and perceive it


#### What would you say is your biggest pain point today with VSP documentation?
- I don't if this is the biggest but a big one for me is the duplication of content. We have taken on a number of issues to reorganize the repositiories and push them around, I went to update on how to respond to incidents docu. but I found 5 diff documentations to address the same exact thing. Someone took the old one, wrote a new one and didn't delete the old one. Theres a good deal of that which also leads it to be outdated. lots of outdated information and the reorg of the resource did not help but there's 100s and 1000s of dev links, 

#### Have you ever seen a standard who is responsible for keeping documentation up to date, or is that something that's not really done?

-  I think it's hard because the target is diferent at times a bit. there's product outlines, the tool that builds the feature for 3 months and we go build somethig else. people leave and then people don't know the structure of what's to date. I do't think Ive seen an attempt of something so far, but I think I'm just blidn to it

#### What are other pain points with VSP doc system?

LF. large files being uploaded, when teams need large files. since w erely on git we have a process with that, but getting sfiles over 25mb into doc. Uusually a sketch file or doc. separating design assets and docs, decisions, I will just thoughtof one. I'm a rails engineer and being pretty fmailar with rails doc. the process there since it's an open surce repositiroy anyone can contribute. 100s of thousands of devs can contribute back. in that regard, encouraging amendments if you think amendments is necessary. Headlining hey this is a team effort. ive seen that it works in the past in the right ecosystem

#### can you tell me a lot more about how that works and what it accomplishes

- docs are updated by those who you use it, in the trenches vs. in command. lends it self to more accuracy in granularity. It also proivides ownership and when you give owenership to your team, it helps with overall qality of work. we have so many users of docs.

- I'll say something, when we were transitioning vets. gov we went through a big doc push that had the idea of something good, but everything that just got transitioned to a new repo and links got broken. Here's a spreadsheet of everything, there's a storytelling aspect of it. a good encompassing view of what becomes products. I don't know who came up with that. As someone new coming on, that would be realy helpful, we only did it because the powers needed it but it got thrown away 

- I think it worked for me, because I was a new person and I got a deep dive about everything. everything was kinda linked to that one document and made it easy for someone to see. as someone in porduct, you can kinda deep dive into it. It also had the owners too, so it had more technical questions 

- I agree that was a uuseful thing to go down the bullet list, this is how I use things. I'm interested in bill have you encountered any of that doc? as you were onvoarding

- I think thebiggest thing, is I realize with vets website, I ahd trobule getting it to build. I needed vets content as well getting it a sibling to make it work 

#### For context, I think what TJ was talking about was the transtiion readiness factor. kinda a table of contents situation

- This was done out of requirements, people kinda suffered to a degree because this was a mandatory thing and i do think we got a lot from this but it disappeared to my knowledge. 

- I know culturally K said, giving people ownership, this seems the oppsote of that

- I thinkt his was a handoff methods. I do recall a lot of...maybe not suffering, but a flurry activity in the last couple sprints. I think that they're...the opnion is not warranted.


#### If you’re directing a VFS team member to information related to their job, where do you go to find it/where do you tell them to go?
- the VAGOV repo, specifically the engineering subsection on their particular role. Generall y I found good success in that repo now. I've directed her to that repo with success. as a BE engineer we spend a good amount of time in the devops folders. It sort of has a source of truth for things, I think that doc should exist in devops for several reasons. 

- Yeah I tried to put..are we talking about onboarding. 

- new VFS member asking you about backend or ops doc. Where are you going to direct them? maybe the answre is nowehre?

- I think that its about what they're asking about. We're in vets gov, now in va gov. depending on the level that they're at that's a good one. if they're wondering about ops in gerneal. there's a va gov team repo. 

#### Do you see yourselves as responsible for keeping any of the above information up to date? How do you ensure that it is accurate?
- yeah I prersnally wouldn be rsponsible the genreal policies and norms. We'd be repsonseible for BE tools folder, maybe the onboarding expiernee for VAgov. Devops repo I would refer to ops person. They would have to merge the change i think 

#### What about *name or name* do you see yourselves repsonsible?

- I'm prob the wrong person to ask becase I get myself in everyhtig

- there's certain documentation to keep up to date that falls on our tea? there's blurry lines on what falls in infrastrcuture, and what can't be touches by backend, there's prob some stuff that's more in our plate. 

- If you saw a document that is out of date, how would you determine who should update that document?
i dont know

- I guess it kind depends, that i know endough to know that it's wrong, but I'll try to correct it in a pull request and hwo might know more about that. we do't have an owener of docs

- i look at the git blame. Kid of like throwing into a wishing well. I'd update it if it needs an update. see who's responsible r mght know about this if there's no clear answer




#### What would you expect see on a successful VSP documentation site?
- I would expect to see, putting my hat as new person, i'd understand the documentation right away. it should be intuitive enough so that id' be able to navigate it. new person would come in saying, ok i can figure this out. At least find where things are at. 

- Any other things? whether that's any ifno or tools/features to be expecting?

- this is maybe a left outfield pitch? cant find what i'm looking for maybe a chat button, or send you directly to slack. That way we can capture that lack of success somehow. Automatiable and you can click a button on what im looking for and be able to write a little on what im trying to find

- specific changer on uses can be useful. Checking on links. doesn't help we have 3 different repos thatit can be and other repos that it can be in. Basic sanity checkin might be useful. 

#### Going off on these features and tools? either something youve contributed to or just used What tools or processes have experience using contributing to? Have you used any in terms of contributing or using that worked or didn't

- I'll profess my love for gitbook till the days end. right now it provides a world calss platform for collaborating. you still have to organize the contetn on archtiectue that makes sense. Not adding overhead that unnecessary I like gitbook a lot. I'd like to investigate more on stack overflow for teams

- have any of ya'll used postman collection?

- yes super helful for devs absolutely. can hearkedn back about speccificaitons we've heard earlier. 

 - I've used gitbook for my personal knowledge wiki but not in a professional environemnt. 

- Any other tools or platforms anyone used?

- Not so much backend side but I've used storybook for FE code. 

- I got mixed reviews on storybook from a remote FE in a react-y world. Esp when a lot of react is optomization. Very much allows you to click the prototype 

- one thing I really enjoy is when people tie in codepends to their documentation. side by side you have actual code running in browser of documentation

- the materual UI react library 

- to add to that, there's something like jupiter notebooks but it's inlining running the code in the doc. acts like a scratch pad. If you're talking about more of an onboarding or technical perspective. Inline code or scratch pads are awesome

- I have one question that i forgot to ask that we were just chatting about as a team, where is the docs know for vets api?

- I know lighthouse team is devlopers va gov

- No, that's sort of separate. We have swagger docs and should be accessible and link. last time I checked it was broken though, developers can handle locally. beyond that the readme in the reposiitory is prob the best doc beyond the code. I velieve that's the case. I think that covers our corners

- Using something like swagger, code having document vs writing it yourself is something to think about. 

- What do you mean by self document?I always get weary when I hear the term

- essentially willt ap into api endpoints based on model of endpoints. Actually generating the etnire webiste, url swagger, test and run things. you dont have to worry about building and maintainng

- this is something we tosed around before to, making sure our API isOAS3, compliant that way we have a suite of tools. We can test, mock servers. Work might be underway in some way or the other 

#### Why do you get wary when you hear the phrase self documenting code?

- Well, idk, it's a kinda like "read the source code dummy" A lot of times i hear it, well go read the soruce code it'll be obvious what it does. that's so not the case, people don't know whatthat hting is. In this case it is awesome but is it as self documenting as you think it is. Writing why docs is not something automated. Oh it's self documented so that's good

- if documenation is includedin well written code, that would be why doc not how doc

- if you're writing doc in code, is doc, not self doc. 

#### does anyone think that works or doesn't work well writen code? would you need spearate doc

- if I don't know language, i could get caught on some things. there's certainly a balance, Comments are necessary when codeis absoutley on baseline level. Comments are part of self documenting code. Codelines tell you what you do. Then there'd be writing english and we don't need code programmers.
