# Discussion Guides - Documentation Site Discovery Sprint 12/2019

## Moderator Logistics
_Use #vsp-documentation-site-discovery in Slack for real-time feedback from observers._

## Intro
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [name] and I am a [role] on [team]. As you may know, VSP is doing a discovery sprint this week regarding documentation, whether that's in the VA.gov ecosystem or about something else entirely. We've got a few other folks from the discovery sprint team here today as well who are observing and taking notes and may chime in with questions as we go.

Before we start, there are a few things I want to mention: 

This entire session is scheduled for an hour. We don't want to keep you any longer than that, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. 

We want to hear your honest opinions, and we welcome your feedback. 

Is it alright with you if I record this call as we talk today? We'll use the recordings to confirm that we captured the conversation accurately, and we'll destroy them after we complete analysis. No comments will be attributed to you directly. 

[If yes, start recording]

Alright, we're recording!

## Standard Questions 

### Provider Questions 
[If applicable] I understand that you've created documentation or contributed to a documentation ecosystem before for others to use. 

As someone who's been involved in documentation management: 
- Talk me through a time when you’ve had a really good experience with documentation.
- What info did that documentation provide? Was it just technical specs about APIs, was it "how-to" and onboarding, was it philosophical "why" documentation?
- How did you know it was good? What made it successful (or not)? What were the results? What behavior were you seeing to indicate that?
- What tools and processes have you found effective in the past?
- What tools and processes have you found ineffective in the past? 
- What processes did you use to set standards across different teams who were contributing to the documentation?
- How did you ensure that the information stayed up to date? 
- What do you think VSP, the platform team, can learn from this example? 
- If you had the chance to create that ecosystem again, what would you do differently?
- If you had to choose 3 things that you think were critical to your success, what would you say those were?

Transition: Great, thanks for all of that info! Now we're going to switch gears a bit and talk about your experience _using_ documentation.

### User Questions
- Talk me through a time when you've had a really good experience using documentation to get something done.
- What info did that documentation provide? Was it just technical specs about APIs, was it "how-to" and onboarding, was it philosophical "why" documentation? 
- Was it paired with any tools or interaction? (Examples: search, sandbox, ability to contribute or ask questions) Did it look a certain way? Were there any other attributes that were particularly useful? What did those tools, interactions, or attributes allow you to accomplish?
- Did you rely solely on those docs, or did you use that and also fill in gaps by asking a bunch of questions elsewhere or using another method?
- What would you say is your biggest pain point today with VSP documentation?

### Extra Questions (if time) — VSP Documentation
- If you’re looking for information related to how to do your job, where do you go to find it?
- If you’re directing a VFS team member to information related to their job, where do you go to find it/where do you tell them to go?
- Do you see yourselves as responsible for keeping any of the above information up to date? How do you ensure that it is accurate?
- What would you expect see on a successful VSP documentation site?

## Questions Specific to Interviewee

### Backend/infrastructure engineers
- Intro
- As engineers, I'm willing to bet that y'all have been involved in creating or managing documentation or documentation tools before. Is that correct? 
- [If yes] Provider questions (above)
- In what ways do you think engineering documentation differs from non-technical documentation? Where is there overlap in the problem space? Where do they diverge?
- User questions (above)
- [If time] Extra questions

### Frontend engineers
- Intro
- I know that at least some of y'all have been involved in creating or managing documentation or documentation tools before.
- Provider questions (above)
- In what ways do you think engineering documentation differs from non-technical documentation? Where is there overlap in the problem space? Where do they diverge?

### Kevin W
- Intro
- Before we get into the specifics of using Drupal for documentation, I'd like to talk a bit about your experience with documentation in general. Have you ever created documentation or contributed to a documentation ecosystem before for others to use?
- [If yes] Provider questions (above)
- [If Drupal was not discussed] OK, great! Thanks for that information. Now, it is my understanding that you wanted to talk a bit about Drupal as a technical solution for documentation. Can you tell us more about that? 
- What pain points does Drupal solve? 
- [If time] User questions (above)

### 18F
- Notetaker: Crystabel
- Tell us about 18F's [handbook](https://handbook.18f.gov/).
- What tools and processes have you found successful with the handbook? What outcomes did those tools and processes generate?
- How does this get maintained and kept up to date? Who owns it? How dispersed is that ownership, and has any of it been designated top-down vs bottom-up (has it ever worked to tell someone they own something)?
- You started by just using GitHub Pages, correct? What worked well with that initial solution? 
- Re: GitHub Pages as your initial solution, what challenges did you encounter there? How have you changed the site to solve for those pain points? How do you preview?
- How do you guage success with a documentation site? What behaviors have you seen to indicate that you've been successful?
- If you could build the handbook ecosystem over again, what would you do differently? 
- Have you built a "culture of documentation" to make this successful? 
- Do y'all have a separate solution for technical documentation? Can you tell us about that? What information is included there?
