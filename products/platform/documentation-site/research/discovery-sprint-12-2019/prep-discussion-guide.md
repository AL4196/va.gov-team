## Intro [Megan to update]
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Megan and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the experience of the VFS team working with the VSP team.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

This entire session should take about 30 min. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the process so we can all better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Start recording.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"

## Standard Questions 

### Provider Questions 
As someone who has created documentation before for others to use:
- Talk me through a time when you’ve had a really successful experience with documentation.
- How did you know it was successful (or not)? What were the results? What behavior were you seeing to indicate that?
- What tools and processes have you found effective in the past?
- What tools and processes have you found ineffective in the past? 
- What processes did you use to set standards across different teams?
- How did you ensure that the information stayed up to date? 
- What do you think VSP, the platform team, can learn from this example? 
- If you had the chance to create that ecosystem again, what would you do differently?
- If you had to choose 3 things that you think were critical to your success, what would you say those were?

Transition: Great, thanks for all of that info! Now we're going to switch gears a bit and talk about your experience _using_ documentation.

### User Questions
- Talk me through a time when you've had a really successful experience using documentation to get something done.
- What info did that documentation provide? Was it just technical specs about APIs, was it "how-to" and onboarding, was it philosophical why documentation? 
- Was it paired with any tools or interaction? (Examples: search, sandbox, ability to contribute or ask questions)
- Did you rely solely on the docs, or did you use that and also fill in gaps by asking a bunch of questions elsewhere or using another method?
- What would you say is your biggest pain point today with VSP documentation?

### Extra Questions (if time) — VSP Documentation
- If you’re looking for information related to how to do your job, where do you go to find it?
- If you’re directing a VFS team member to information related to their job, where do you go to find it/where do you tell them to go?
- Do you see yourselves as responsible for keeping any of the above information up to date? How do you ensure that it is accurate?
