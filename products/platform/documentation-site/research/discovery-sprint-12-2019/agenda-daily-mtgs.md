## Day 1 Start Meeting Notes
- Rachael is facilitator! She's here to help keep things moving along, the rest of folks are active participants. 
- Each day we have a goal and a tactical representation of what work should be complete to lead us toward that goal. Before today, our goal was to understand where we are with documentation and the research that has already been done. 
- Today, our objective is to prioritize what to focus on. Tangible goal: lean UX outline.
- Walked through schedule for week 
- Qs from Megan: rescheduling Jenny HL, and deciding attendees for 18F mtg Tues AM
  - Jenny HL rescheduled to Friday, will ask her to let us know if she's available earlier
  - 18F meeting Tuesday morning: Megan, Mikki, Crystabel
- All interview meetings notes should be taken in THE SAME markdown file
- Backend/infrastructure engineers — Megan moderate, Crystabel notetake 
- Frontend engineers - Crystabel moderate, Mikki notetake
- Question from Mikki: is the va.gov-team repo a solution that we're evaluating? Rachael: that can be a solution that we evaluate and recommend if we decide that is best!

## Day 1 End Meeting Notes 
- Roundtable takeaways
  - Differences btwn good documentaton culture and bad. Good = if you see the need take the lead. Figure out how to update something when there's a hole in it.
  - We barely talked about large file storage, which is something I have been thinking about a lot before this. Maybe the learning is that this isn't the biggest pain point that doc site needs to solve...
  - Ownership is going to be a really interesting challenge to figure out. When asked in interviews, no one indicated they feel responsible for updating documentation. "Maybe yeah, but I don't" type of answer.
  - Common thing around searchability. "I'd like to have the ability to query this thing when I need it in the moment"
  - Reason for not wanting product documentation in/near code: it muddies the search results when looking for technical things.
  - Off the shelf solutions wouldn't require an in-house engineer to maintain, support comes with it. Interesting option, preferred by VSP technical interviewees.
  - Trust. "Is this the source of truth? Is it valid? Has it been updated?"
  - How do we make updating documentation a priority. How can we make it easy? How can we make it clear what needs to be documented? Otherwise, it's not going to happen.
- 18F interview
  - They're not using the handbook for technical work/documentation, it's largely about onboarding folks to 18F and cover whole gambit of onboarding a person, how to engage, etc (a lot of overlap w/our needs). It kicked off at least 3 years ago w/a ton of user research into what we've laid out in our research too, they started w/just GitHub pages, now have a way to preview the page before submitting it. Could be interesting to ask them: what are the challenges to having a GH powered site, why did you add those preview capabilities? How much do you / would you recommend using this kind of thing for technical documentation? Is there overlap there? 
  - Can we also ask what worked well with the initial solution?
  - Who owns it? How is it kept up to date?
  - **Notetaker: Crystabel**
  - **Interviewer: Megan**
- KW interview
  - **Notetaker: Megan**
  - **Interviewer: Crystabel**
- Crystabel: set up deck for rapid sketching, update convo guides for future interviews
- Megan: update rational for personas and decision on priority
- Bill and Dan: pros and cons of various techincal solution options
- Mikki: refine notes from first 2 interviews
