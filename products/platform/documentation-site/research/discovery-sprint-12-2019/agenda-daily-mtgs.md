## Day 1 Start Meeting Notes
- Rachael is facilitator! She's here to help keep things moving along, the rest of folks are active participants. 
- Each day we have a goal and a tactical representation of what work should be complete to lead us toward that goal. Before today, our goal was to understand where we are with documentation and the research that has already been done.
