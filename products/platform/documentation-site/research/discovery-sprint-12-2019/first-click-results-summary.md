# Results Summary

## Background
As part of the documentation site discovery sprint, we wanted to evaluate a feature set against key tasks with users.  

## Goals

We wanted to answer the following questions:



## Method
A Chalkmark (i.e. first click test) was utilized through Optimal Workshop.   Participants were given a scenario and asked to click where on the page they would look/go to complete or answer that scenario.  Mock-ups of a hypothetical documentation site were utilized. 


### Dates
The test ran from approximately 5pm ET Thursday, December 19 through 1pm Friday, December 20.
This timing allowed west coast individuals to complete the test in the latter half of their work day thursday and was available to east coast individuals in the early half of their day on Friday.

- A total of 43 people completed the study.
- Participant self-identified roles:
  - Enginneering & Ops - 12
  - Product Management - 9
  - Leadership - 8
  - Design & Research - 7
  - Other noted roles - 7 (included 2 Content and IA, 1 QA, 2 Analytics, 1 "a little bit of everything", and a VA stakeholder)
- Participant self-identified teams:
  - VSP - 15
  - VFS - 13
