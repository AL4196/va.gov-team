# Lean UX Outline: Documentation Site

## 1. Problem Statement

We created a myriad of documentation that was designed to help our customers (i.e. VFS teams building things on VA.gov) find what they need to work seamlessly and iteratively, and build great products on VA.gov. We have observed that the resources as they exist today aren’t effectively enabling that, which is causing a large support burden for VSP, is frustrating our customers, and is potentially resulting in products on VA.gov that don't meet VSP standards. *How might we improve our documentation resources so that our customers are more successful?*


### What are our desired outcomes?



### In what ways are those outcomes not being met?



## 2. Proto-Personas

Persona 1: Technical VFS team member (engineer)
- Behavioral traits
  - Store documentation elsewhere (such as Confluence)
  - Already have their own existing documentation methods (cultural differences)
- Pain points and needs
  - Cultural differences in documentation tools and methods
- Solutions today
- Possible solutions

Persona 2: Non-technical VFS team member
- Behavioral traits
- Pain points and needs
  - May not know how to use GitHub or Markdown
- Solutions today
- Possible solutions

## 3. Pain point prioritization

Pain point
How painful (1-3)?
How widespread (1-3)?
How sure are we that it's a problem we must solve to achieve our desired outcomes(1-3)?
Sum: 

## 4. Prioritized user stories


## 5. Assumptions

### Business Assumptions

I believe my customers have a need to:
 
I believe my initial customers are (or will be):
 
I believe the #1 value a customer wants to get out of my service is:

I believe my customer can also get these additional benefits:

I believe I will acquire the majority of my customers through:

I believe my biggest product risk is:

We will solve this through:

What other assumptions do we have that, if proven false, will cause our project to fail?

### User Assumptions

Who is the user? 
- Cultural differences make it hard to adopt one standard documentation across all teams

What problems does our product solve?

When and how is our product used?

What features are important?

How should our product look and behave?

6. Based on pain points, user stories, and assumptions, select hypotheses for MVP:

We believe that: [creating this capability/feature] for [these people/personas] will result in: [this outcome]. We will know we are right when: [we see this measurable signal].

_This is a skeleton template to use if you’re following the Lean UX process, based off the book & Nick Brethauer’s Lean UX Crash Course. I’m sure there’s more structure that can be added to the later sections, but this is a start._
