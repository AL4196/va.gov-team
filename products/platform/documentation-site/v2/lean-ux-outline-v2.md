# Lean UX Outline - Docs Site V2

Team: VSP Content & IA
Timeframe: Q2 2020 

_Based on the [Lean UX Outline from 12/19 discovery sprint](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/documentation-site/research/discovery-sprint-12-2019/lean-ux-outline.md)._

## Problem Statement 

VSP has created and updated many VFS-facing documents with the intention of providing clarity and tools for self-service to teams building on VA.gov. We are still observing that our documentation resources are not enabling teams to build seamlessly and iteratively on their own, and the one-off content-based updates we have been making are only helpful if teams are aware of and can find them when they need them. How might we identify and improve the user experience for a core set of VSP-owned documentation in order to create a set of introductory user guides for building on VA.gov? 

## Proto-personas

VFS teams (including contractors and embedded DEPO members, both technical and non-technical), are the top priority for the next iteration of the documentation site. We _assume_ that these teams are the greatest source of documentation support requests and "non-human-needed" manual support requests to VSP.

See [previous Lean UX Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/documentation-site/research/discovery-sprint-12-2019/lean-ux-outline.md) for full list of proto-personas â€” the list of personas has not changed, but our focus has.

## Assumptions 

### Business 

We assume that documentation must default to public, in line with DEPO's "default to transparency" culture.
We assume that some documentation cannot be public.
We assume that 

### User

We assume that the majority of documentation support requests come to VSP from VFS team members.
We assume that product documentation should come be created and maintained by VFS teams.
We assume that cultural differences among all teams building on and in support of VA.gov make it hard to adopt one standard documentation process across all teams.
