# Release Plan Template

---

## Phase I: soft release to VSP

### Planning:
- Desired date range or test duration: Sprint 21-22 (during MVP build)
- Desired number of users: VSP (voluntary) - ideally feedback from 10+ users
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: solicit feedback in VSP Slack channels
- How you'll conduct the testing: mostly asynchronous feedback, may solicit feedback from folks in quick meetings
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: will be visible in a [sandbox](https://doc-landing-page-mvp-tisq4.csb.app/) or on GitHub page _(in other words, this will be live)_

### Results:
- Number of users: x
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

## Phase II: (beta) release to VSP and VFS!

### Planning:
- Desired date range: release by end of Sprint 22/Sprint 23 (by end of March 2020), gather feedback throughout April
- Desired number of unique users: 200+
- How you'll make the product available in production while limiting the # of users who can find/access it: we will not limit access to the product; we will clarify that this is a beta site and we are looking for feedback. There is little-to-no risk to releasing an unfinished/imperfect product, and much to be gained from starting to get feedback.
- "Success" criteria (by the numbers):
  - Average uniques/day for April increase over time
  - Average uniques/day for April > 25
  - ???
- Other KPIs: 
  - ???

### 2-week results (target April 15):
- Number of unique users: x
- Actual results (per your "success criteria")
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

### 1-month results (target end of April): 
- Number of unique users: x
- Actual results (per your "success criteria")
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

## 1-month evaluation

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
