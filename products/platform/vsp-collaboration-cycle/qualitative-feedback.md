## Qualitative Feedback 

### Moderated Testing 

_Rollout meetings with VSA teams_ 

"I still feel confused on how this fits in with the VSA workflows. How does this work with how often we're meeting with Tze and Jennifer? All the processes you presented are great and well-organized and make a lot of sense, I just wish I personally had a better picture of the workflow and overall timeline with team-specific elements mixed in." 

"It seems like so many hands"

(Product Manager) "Can some of these things fall more on developers? And/or, can I put all the needed documentaiton in one place so I'm not copying it into every ticket? What is a 'how to proceed as a VFS PM' timeline?"

"I got immediate feedback from my team that they are very stoked about the new and more organized process" 

"I feel like (partially because we were working closely with Shawna) we did some of the check-ins (even though it was a bit disjointed). I am into it. I work better when there are processes in place!"

"Nothing in particular just felt very dense, not that it shouldn't be, just felt like more time should have been allotted for the meeting."

"It seems like there should be more in between Discover and Build - like checkins on progress, etc"

"Excited to try it!"

"Thank you for all the work and taking the time to walk us through it!"

"Seems like it was well thought out and should run smoothly."

"Thank you very much for reviewing all of these areas and requirements with our team, although we have a unique product, it was extremely helpful to determine how, when, and with whom we need to collaborate. This is also helpful if we ever do, cross the bridge of develop, design, and build an application in our work space. Great WORK!"

From 3/12 meeting with BAH -- they are going to be going through the collaboration cycle and comparing it to the handbook. Showing any gaps or new pain points with the new process. Amy K. did bring up that the handbook had information about where to store artifacts that the collaboration cycle doesn't have

"Very much appreciate your assistance!"

Should think about regression test plans and when we require them because teams are just having Tze build them in a box, which isn't helpful to the whole scrum team. Should we move that artifact later in the process? Work with peter on this. 

Need to add ATO to collab cycle once their training materials are ready. 

### Unmoderated Testing

*From Collaboration Point Survey (linked above) as of 4/21/20 — note that 58.3% of respondents noted that they had just completed Project Kickoff*

- Reviewers gave actionable feedback to aid in improving our solution. The feedback was specific and to the point, and it gave us options for other things we could try.
- Thank you for taking the time to meet, we appreciate your feedback and ideas!
- It was not clear to me when the async feedback was complete. I got a few sub-issues assigned to me but not everyone assigned one so wasn't sure if that meant "it's all good" or if it meant "I haven't gotten around to this yet". The required vs recommended changes were initially ambiguous. Although it is not the intention, at this point the review felt like it added extra work on my plate (not to take action on the recommendations, but just the process of initiating, organizing, responding, etc), and extra time to my timeline. The feedback provided yielded good improvements though.
- First-time through, so useful to understand what pieces of information VSP finds valuable at this stage, so that we can ensure we're emphasizing them as we actually begin discovery on the project.
- 	• too many steps • too hard to tell where things are in the process • too easy to get things mixed up in github with all the tickets • good to get feedback • feedback definitely helpful
- The efforts discussed are relatively straight-forward and required very little discussion.
- We provided context for the work we are planning
- It was good for everyone to get aligned but it was new to everyone and the only real questions anyone had were about the process and not the project. I expect as we do more of these, it'll become more valuable.
- I thought part of the meeting would be to review our product outline to identify any areas that we need to improve upon. The meeting went by very quickly overall and didn't feel super informative.
- We just had the logged in homepage kickoff, and it was an effective way to get a large # of people up to speed on the work we're doing and to field conversation/questions.

# Additional Notes from VSP Reviewers & Moderators 

### Megan notes from rollout mtgs 

- Numerous teams have had questions about the contact center review — timing, and also guidance on how to create those artifacts. Talked with vsp analytics 3/6/20
- QA artifacts as part of Usability Testing Prep are _really_ tripping people up, they do not seem thrilled (curious to see if we get the same feedback in the post-review surveys?) 3/6/20
- Related, the 2 Usability Testing Prep templates we've had so far have both been created by the team designer, which is not our guidance -- that could be why the QA artifacts are confusing, bc the designer doesn't know why they need to think about QA? 3/6/20
- Need to add a step into templates that has Megan/Andrea assign ticket back to requesting team once meeting has been scheduled 3/6/20
- Need to change templates to have requesting team put email addresses of attendees
- Need to change templates to include our times that are blocked off for reviews in the "Scheduling" section
