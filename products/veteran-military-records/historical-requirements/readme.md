This directory contains original requirements for the VA Letters Generator in eBenefits.  

These documents are for *historical reference only*, and lend insight to how VA stakeholders were thinking during the original development of this feature in eBenefits (not vets.gov).

These should not be considered as requirements for VA Letters on vets.gov, but may be referred to by stakeholders when requirements are discussed.
