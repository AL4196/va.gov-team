# DD214 Pre-Discovery Sprint Carter (Scope, Output, Roles)

## Sprint Goals and Scope

- Gather any info the team has previously learned about the DD214
- Have enough information to allow the team to figure out whether we need: 
  - full-on discovery work to detail what would be needed to get this onto Vets.gov OR 
  - another path that is not currently evident

### What is NOT in scope of this sprint
- This is pre-discovery and not a full discovery, design, or research sprint

## Outputs
- Pre-Discovery Sprint Readout Deck


## Timeline
- Week of Nov 27: initial conversations and development of this charter
- Week of Dec 4: continue learning about DD214, eMIS and how they interface based on DSVA work thus far
- Week of Dec 11: talk with Defense contacts about legal standing of DD214; start drafting output deck outlining what DD214 fields DSVA currently has access to via eMIS; 
- Week of Dec 18: finalize deck; schedule internal DSVA readout with Clare and Kerry
- Week of Dec 25: develop charter for next discovery sprint on this topic

## Risks and Mitigation
- Robbie, who has institutional knowledge about DD214, will be transitioning to USDS HQ in the next few weeks. 
    - Mitigation: work as quickly as possible to capture what he knows in Sprint Outputs

## Team Roles
- Sprint Lead (manages stand-ups, team communication, etc): Marvo, StratOps
- Engineering Lead: Robbie, Engineering

## Resources
- Gabriel and Natalie have Pentagon contacts who know about DD214 and eMIS
