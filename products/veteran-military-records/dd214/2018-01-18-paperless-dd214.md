# Call with Mark Shaughnessy about the "Paperless DD214" work
### DSVA Participants: Raquel, Steve K., Marvo
- “Paperless DD214” is language for (Senior Executive Service) SES folks
  - Really it’s about information from DEERS which he describes as the same thing as VADIR
- Real goal is to provide a credential
- Care and feeding of DEERS is conducted by the Defense Manpower Data Center
- Title 38 rules determine whether or not you're a Veteran
  - Applebees, Home Depot and other retailers are likely not as concerned about statutory details because they want to attract customers
- eMIS logic looks through all DD214s
- Vet360 would have business logic and Vets.gov would surface this to Veterans
- Possible Projects:
1. Root out and end practice of asking people for Military Service History
1. Ability to identify proof then serve Military Service History *to* Veteran instead of asking them for it
1. Credential of Veteran status on a Profile Page
- Team may want to check with SMEs for the forms Mark is saying we don't need filled out by Veternas when they apply for benefits
- Mark has requirements and Data Models
- [X] Mark to send us this information. [Sent 01/19/2018.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Global/SiP-Prefill/Prefill/eMIS_Integration/eMIS_Documents/20150907%20Enterprise%20Military%20Information%20Service%20RAP%205.xlsx)
