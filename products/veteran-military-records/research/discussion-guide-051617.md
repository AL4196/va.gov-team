v.1<br>

May 16, 2017


## Test Objectives

Determine usability problem areas within the download letters user interface. Potential problem areas: 

- Navigation: Is it clear how to locate key functions, excessive keystrokes to complete a function, failure to follow screenflow. 

- Presentation: Is it clear how to locate and properly act upon desired information in screens. Are the labels clear? Is the language right?

- Control usage: Are the text fields and buttons used properly?

## Methodology

The unicorns team will conduct one-on-one interviews with veterans and certifying officers that often review benefit letters. 

First the following introduction will be shared.

### Intro

Thank you for agreeing to participate in this user testing session. We value your feedback and sessions like these help inform vets.gov, making it a great experience for you. 

The vets.gov team has been working on a new feature that’ll help veterans get the information they need to prove eligibility or benefit status. For example, you can get proof of service or a benefit verification letter. 

Before we get started, I have a couple of questions for you. 

- Have you recently been asked to provide documentation to support a benefit claim or application? If yes, how did you get the documentation?

- Have you recently used the eBenefits site? Why did you use it?
