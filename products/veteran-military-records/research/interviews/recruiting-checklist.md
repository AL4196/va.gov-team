# Recruiting Checklist

## Step 1: Define Your User
Assigned: Laura

It is important to be selective when looking for research participants. Friends and family are better than nothing, don't get me wrong. However, finding people that are real users will get you better data to work with and you'll waste less time.

To start this process, you can define a set of user perspectives you need to get. Think of this as your "[circle of extremes](http://www.designkit.org/methods/45)." 

## Step 2: Write Screener 
Assigned: Laura

The screener should help you find the right people for your study. The screener should include these elements:

- Intro with description of the study, what type of participants you are looking for, compensation and any rules for how you recruit.
- First and last name
- Email
- Phone number
- Times they can attend with 2-hour slots defined. Example: 9 a.m. ET to 11 a.m. ET
- Questions that help you narrow your users to match your study, users you want to talk to and users you should avoid

## Step 3: Create Schedule, Confirm Testers

The schedule should be accessbile to everyone and created in such a way that allows you to monitor when you have found someone that maps to your circle of extremes and slotted into an available time slot. Variables on a schedule include:

- Time Slot
- Type of Extreme
- Email
- Session Link
