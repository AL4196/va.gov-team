## Have you recently been asked to provide documentation to support a benefit claim or application? If yes, how did you get the documentation?

### Participant 1
Education benefits - institution needed to provide proof of enrollment and each quarter she'd print out documentation and then scan it back in, not too tedious, probably could have been more efficient to scan it from portal onto her PC and then save and send, but that's not a VA or website thing, just an institutional thing. And needed DD214 for Disability around 2004. Has applied via USA Jobs and in order to utilize 10% service connected disability, need to provide that VA Letter, and also had to use her DD214 and send it w/each application. Just saved it to her USA Jobs profile and re-used it bc it doesn't change. Has had to receive copy of her DD214 (years ago) and believes she had to call local VA office for them to send a copy, and another time she was able to request one through an online portal then it takes some time for them to process and send it via mail.

## Have you recently used the eBenefits site? Why did you use it? 

### Participant 1
Yes, recently got married (within past 1.5 years) so needs to update DEERS info, and to get to that website you have to go through eBenefits, well not sure if it's actually eBen but believes it's connected. To update her name. Hardest part was remembering password. She found out where to do this by Googling it "what process to change your name". And first 5 hits said something related to DEERs.

## What questions did the person have about the address? Was it clear what would happen if the address was not correct? 

### Participant 1
Reading through... assuming any Letters you need from VA for confirmation you can download these to your actual PC. But also, **looks like you have to verify your name and address before you download to make sure it's you and the right letter is downloaded and you don't get someone else's by mistake. Oh you can update your address! That's pretty cool. I think I've seen that before where you can change the address as it appears on the letter, but not to be confused w/permanently changing your address. I think I've seen it before in DEERS, can't update your name, but you can update your address, bc I've done it.**

## What do you think this page is for?

### Participant 1
self explanatory. and the fact you have the blue circles 1 and 2, it directs your attention, versus having to read thru all the paragraphs. You get a quick snapshot just by looking at those bullet points.

## Service History. What did the person click on first? What did they click on next?
Clicked to expand Proof of Service Letter. Then did same for Service Verification Letter. Seem to be similar, one's just verification that you were in the service and the one is just to provide the letter. This would not point me to think it has service history? Proof of service could serve as time served... (beg and end dates) but service history = beginning and end, but also locations in between, duty stations, sort of like a record? **I'd toggle between downloading both to see which one I need. I'd think either one would suffice. Ok so this is an actual card.** [expected?] Proof of Service: **No bc I don't see the time that you served... I wouldn't download this one, it's not what I need as far as service history. Service Veri: Yes ok so this is exactly what I was thinking, I wasn't expected character of service but that's actually really good, that way you don't need a separate letter in addition to this. Encompasses everything. The word "history" in the title would make it easier to find. That's a specific keyword.**

## Find a document to verify you have health coverage.

### Participant 1
**Benefit Verification Letter**, hm shows I have coverage but doesn't actually say. It shows how much I'm covered and when it started and amounts paid. Yeah this would suffice.

## Open Benefit Summary

### Participant 1
Sort of like a service history, versus a benefit history. Not very explanatory imo, it doesn't say this person is covered in this year, this period, this time, only shows that you're in the armed services and the time you served there. **Let me see if I can scroll down. Oh! I didn't see that. So this looks like a disability statement to me, gives %, award amount, when it's effective, what you're entitled to... but to me it still doesn't say what kind of coverage I would have. Coverage = health insurance, any kind of health or dental insurance which I know the VA offers, so for personal/family coverage i'd be looking for that. Benefits = an addition to your health insurance,** so the VA offers this additional benefit like an annual checkup or some kind of addtnl services. in the past, she's seen that on ebenefits.

## Benefit Summary Letter Options

### Participant 1
**For privacy? Some info might not be relative to who's requesting stuff and what they're asking for. Is this section supposed to be about health coverage? You had asked where to find the ACA info.** [ Another name for this section? ] Service History Letter or Proof of Service?
