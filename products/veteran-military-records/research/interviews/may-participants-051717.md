#### User research session, Wednesday, May 17, 9AM

- He rarely uses his computer; mostly accesses information online on his phone
- First thing he's trying to figure out is what the warning is for
- Reads the initial title and alert message
- Then looks at the tabs at the top and figure out what those are for
- "This is just for award letters, is that right?"
  - For example, he went to Iraq; because of that he is awarded the Post 9/11 GI Bill
  - In order to verify that, he needs to give the award letter to his facility (the VA should send that)
  - He finds it confusing that the language "Award Letter" is not included on this page
  - He would be more specific on what letters we're talking about: for housing, letters aren't needed, but for jobs/education, letters are needed
- It would be awesome if he could access his DD214 through Letters
- To view his summary letter, he would probably first go to "Explore your benefits" or "Your Account" (doesn't seem to see that the page he is on would lead him to his letter)
- Some of the letters say "Download" and some say "Generate"; what he wonders is "What's instant? How fast can I get these letters?". Seems like "Download" would get him the letter right away. Doesn't know what "Generate" would give him.
	- Maybe what it means by "Generate" is that he has to fill in some information first
- For the "Need Help?" section on the right, a lot of times veterans don't want to call for help for anything. It would be awesome if there was an online chat tool to be able to ask for help online, to be able to ask small questions about how to use the website.
- Benefits summary page: seems pretty straightforward, click the boxes and click "Download"
  - That takes you to a preview page; but how do you then download the letter? He looks for a button or something that specifically will download the letter
  - How he feel when something is automatically downloaded: he likes when there is a prompt or warning to let you know something is about to download, because sometimes something is downloaded and you don't realize it or notice it
- In the past when he had to get his award letter, he called the VA, was on hold for a very long time, gave the information to someone, he had to wait for VA to mail the letter to school, he waited awhile, but his school never received the letter, so he had to go through the process all over again
  - For the GI Bill, he had to submit award letters every 3 months, so to go through that process every 3 months was difficult. If he was able to just download the letter online, he would want to "just hug someone"
- He wants more language explaining everything; it should be something an older veteran should be able to understand, especially those who aren't that good with computers
- He likes how it's set up, it's not too flashy, it's to the point
- He's most excited about how this is instant, the speed of it. The whole purpose of this is to make it convenient and fast, especially to get simple things like a piece of paper. It shouldn't take a month to get a piece of paper.
- This is a good idea because there's not a lot of access that veterans have to their information
- Second prototype: it makes him want to start clicking stuff. Things are hiding and he needs to reveal them.
  - "Aw that's cute! That's a little bit more efficient. Instead of going to the next stage everything is right there."
  - He prefers the second prototype because it's a lot more efficient, you don't have to go to the next page.
  - It makes sense to him that the plus sign expands something, but older veterans might be confused.
- $20/$25 is a good incentive amount ($5/$10 isn't enough)

### Sophia's notes for GB

* Looks first at the PDF warning and then at navigation, THEN reads intro text
* “This is just for award letters? Is that right?” Went to Iraq, he’s awarded post-9/11 GI Bill. When you have to verify that you have to take it to edu facility and give them an award letter (which VA sends). 
* “All I can think of [with VA letters] are the awards letters…all of these letters are…verification letters.” 
* “I would be more specific about what letters you’re talking about.” Some letters they don’t have to send (like for mortgages) and others they do.
* Would be awesome if they could access DDT14 through Letters.

Imagine you were just asked to provide a summary of your benefits, what would you do first on this page?
* Goes immediately to “explore benefits” — “it’s the bigger folder.” OR he’d go to My Account. “If I couldn’t find it I’d go to Manage health benefits.” The long and short of it is he’s totally ignoring the Letters interface

* Do users find anything about the language confusing?
    * Didn’t pick up that we were asking him to use the Letters interface — but didn’t read the intro text until we prompted.
    * Which “letters”, exactly?
    * Download v. Generate. “What’s instant?…Generate seems like something that has to come from scratch.” 
    * “I like that it’s a download process because I don’t have to wait…”
    * Generate is a mystery. “If I click this button, then what?” Have to fill in information. “Maybe that’s what it means by generate? Might just me being a computer guy thinking too hard.”
    * “There’s nothing that seems confusing but I notice that on neither one of these tabs…on ‘need help,’ I know a lot of Veterans who don’t want to call for anything. Would be awesome if there was an online help…somebody you could talk to in a chat, and ask questions. Those small questions, like what does ‘generate’ mean?” Questions about using the website, not VA generally. 
    * “Some people don’t want to do it first, and then be wrong.”

* Do the CTA's "Generate Letter" and "Download Letter" make sense to the user?
    * Generate gave the impression it wasn’t an instant or quick process
* Do they say they would select "Generate Letter?"
    * Only once prompted.

* Does anything standout or seem confusing?
    * Nothing seems confusing — except for the PDF window, which he thought was a preview. Went looking for a ‘download’ button. “A prompt would be nice” as opposed to automatic download “because then you know it’s doing it.” 

Had to call VA and ask for an award letter back in the day. Would love to not have to do that again.

“Nobody likes to read, but I like everything to be clear…I don’t think there are enough words. I think it could be dumber. That sounds bad…but some of them are a whole lot older who need this information. You would want it to be something as simple as an 80 year old could understand.” 

* He’s 28 and works with computers, so this makes perfect sense to him, but someone like his dad who doesn’t might have an issue 
* A chatbot would be amazing — cites Groupon, Walmart
* “I do enjoy how this is set up. It’s right to the point, because that’s what we want — to get to the point.”
* Most exciting: it’s instant! “The speed of it.” The VA never answers the phone. “The whole purpose of this is to make it more convenient and fast. Little pieces of paper like this shouldn’t take a month.”

A word besides “generate:”
* “Let’s see….I understand it. It makes sense that it would be that, but I don’t know…I don’t know that anybody else would think about that the way I did. Generate in computer language means something a little different…it’s a command. So no, I couldn’t think of anything else.”

Prototype B (https://marvelapp.com/290dhhg/screen/27986148)

Task 1: Verify your address. Page
Script: Take a second to look at this page. What do you think this page is for?
* “It makes me want to start clicking stuff…stuff is hidden from me.” 
* Asks to open accordions. “Oh, that’s cute! That’s a little bit more efficient, I think. Instead of going to the next page, it’s already there! I like that!”
* “This makes me excited, I want to see stuff!” 
* “I like this one better. Bam! You’re already done. It’s a lot more efficient because you don’t have to skip to the next page [on benefits summary letter]….this is just a little more efficient, it will save time. You don’t have to keep skipping pages.”
* The + makes sense to him, but “I’m a younger Veteran, plus signs means there’s a drop down.” Older Vets didn’t learn that in elementary school.
* “Your guys’ job is hard!” 

On research/referrals 

* Has been telling people about Vets.gov and doing our research — $25, $20 is cool, that will work, but $5-10 is not enough incentive.

### Sophia's notes for NJ

Letters Testing: Nathan Jarvis

#### Takeaways
#1: Don’t make the veteran confirm the address every time he visits letters -- every six months or so is ok "There's always something new" when he has to log in, and sometimes he's in a hurry.
#2: Out of scope for this, but confirming (again) that the password requirements on eBenefits present a barrier to entry that might be higher than we'd like. 
#3: Accordion definitely tests better than cards.		

* Have you recently been asked to provide documentation to support a benefit claim or application? If yes, how did you get the documentation?
    * It’s been about a year.
    * Had to submit a request to PCP, and they had to fax it to “whoever…part of that claims department.”
    * Second step was through VA — they greeted him when he came back.
    * Tracking progress, knowing what to do next, what was needed to upload was done through eBenefits.

Prototype B (accordions)

Task 1: Verify your address. 
Script: Take a second to look at this page. What do you think this page is for?
Imagine you were just asked to provide a summary of your benefits, what would you do first on this page?

* “This I could see being any kind of communication VA has with me…just seeing a bunch of documents. I think I could get any of that here as well as things like the healthcare [form]…so I don’t have to have healthcare because I have it through VA, so I can avoid the ACA tax.”
* “It looks like it’s my first time with the get started. I’d expect it to be health…or education or things like that.

Asked to get benefits letter

* Goes to Get Started “I guess I’m this person!”
* “I never had a time where I didn’t need everything.”
* Commissary letter is unfamiliar to him — doesn’t have a ton of experience with letters. 
* Would click service time, leave everything checked, and click “download letter” then save or print —> to get benefits letter
* He has a folder system of Army documents, so he’d save it there and then either e-mail it to requester or print and attach to documents.
* “The verify address…that’d annoy me, doing it multiple times every single times. I’m already logged in…that process is annoying enough. That’s the reason I haven’t used eBenefits in a couple of months, I an’t think of a password. There requirements are so awful….I’m already annoyed at this point.”


Prototype A (cards)

Task 1: Verify your address. 

* So this one is even an additional step, compared to the last one, because I don’t have the buttons on the first part. 
* “With the ‘generate letter’ I’m not exactly sure — if I hadn’t seen [the other prototype] I wouldn’t know what this is. I wouldn’t expect to be taken to an additional screen.”
* Would expect the same behavior whether the buttons says “generate” or “download”
* “They’re usually claim-related letters.”

* The first version is a laid out a little better 
* “Usually I’m in a rush to get the information, and that one little step that I hate going through…every single time. It always feels like there’s something extra I have to do to get the information I want. Every time I log in there’s always something!”
    * Would expect to see address verification in “need help” or as an alert to confirm his address.
    * Hasn’t moved more than once a year — would be ok every six months or so. 



Script: Take a second to look at this page. What do you think this page is for?
Imagine you were just asked to provide a summary of your benefits, what would you do first on this page?
Questions
* If unsuccessful, the user will be asked what they were looking for.
* If successful, the user would be asked were there any surprises? What’s missing?
Take notes on these areas
* Do users find anything about the language confusing?
* Did the person ask what happens if address is incorrect? If the user clicks on "no" the address is incorrect, do they find the process for correcting it satisfactory?

Task 2: Select the Letter. Page
Script: Take a second to look at this page.
Questions
* Does anything standout or seem confusing?
* What do you want to do next?
Take notes on these areas
* Do they click on the (+) sign? Are they surprised to find the "Download" button there? Do they read the text?
* Does it seem like the names of the letters are familiar or do they need to read the descriptions to understand what is going on here?

Task 3: Download the Benefits Letter. Page
Script: Now, I want you to download the benefits summary letter.
Questions
* What can you do in this section?
* Does anything standout or seem confusing?
* What do you want to do next?
Take notes on these areas
* How is the user managing the scroll? Are they scrolling up and down a lot? Write any observations about the usability of the information in the accordion.
* Is it clear why they would select options or what the options section purpose is?
* Do they try to click anything before getting to download letter?
* How do they expect the letter to download?
General Feedback:
Tell us one way you would improve this process.
Tell us what most excites you about this.

## Notes

#### User Research Session: Friday, May 19 2017

- Right the proof of rating letter is hard to get: today he would go through eBenefits and download it through there. He did that himself a year ago.
  - eBenefits is hard to navigate in general. 
  - He had to Google how to download the letter and what stesp he had to take.
  - He'd expect some kind of call out in the navigation in order to find it.
  - He didn't know which letter he needed last year when he went to download it
- The top area with the content seems a little heavy (on the first page); it's a lot to read
- He needed the letter to prove his disability rating
- He doesn't know what a Commissary Letter is
- He doesn't know what the 3 options are when looking at the download letters page
- He's confused on which letter he actually has to download in order to get his rating information
- When he clicked "Download letter" he wouldn't have expected it to open the letter; he would have expected it to just download
  - Since it just opened the letter, did it actually download?
- The second prototype is better (the one without the accordions, just the boxes with the download or generate button within it)
  - It helps explains things a little better (seeing the explanatory text right away)
  - The thing that stands out the most is that 2 of the buttons say "Download" and one button says "Generate"; but he doesn't know what "Generate" means in this context; this is his only issue with this page
  - This page is a lot better than the other one
- If he was on Vets.gov, he would look for the VA Letters under disability benefits; once he was logged in, he would expect to see it in his dashboard; "I would expect it to be easily accessible"
- He wouldn't expect the benefit summary letter to give a description of how he got his rating (that's medical information, most people don't need to know that)
- It's hard to navigate on eBenefits and to find what you're looking for.

## Notes
#### User Research Session: Monday, May 22 2017

- He had trouble reading the content; the font was too small at first
- Had to ask if he would click on the plus sign to see the "Benefit summary letter" in the accordions prototype
- Looking through the content everything seems clear to him
- Once on the Benefit summary letter page, he would uncheck the military service periods that didn't apply to him; he would make sure the check the one that covers his period of service. He would probably also uncheck the one about death because he's still alive.
- He would then click "Download letter" and expect to get the summary of benefits. He would expect that he might see an option to either get it digitally or have it mailed to him.
- Once on the page with the letter, he looks for an option of how to get the letter (digitally or in the mail)
- The format he prefers depends on what he's using it for. If he wanted to mail it someone, it would be helpful to have it as a pdf he could save. If he needed to mail it he could print it out himself.
- He would expect to be able to right click and then select Save as pdf
- A print icon would be handy so you can just click that and print what you're looking at
- He notices that the cards are more prominent than the accordions, but he didn't have trouble using the accordions
- His first thought of where to find letters on the homepage is under "Disability Benefits"
  - "Since I am disabled, that's probably where I would go."
- "I have VA phone numbers memorized, so when I need something I just call."
- "I do receive a VA pension, and it would be nice to be able to go on [Vets.gov] and get an award letter instead of calling."
  - If he's borrowing money for something and needs income verification, he needs the letter
  - Usually has to ask for it once a year, sometimes it gets lost and he'll need a new one
- Distinction in his mind on award letters is 1) all the benefits available, 2) the ones he's specifically receiving.
  - He's never received a letter for what he's eligible for
- He would expect to see applications for all kinds of benefits on Vets.gov once he click the different areas, like "Health care" or "education"
