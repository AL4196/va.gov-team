The good:

* lots of very positive feedback 
    * “I can't wait until this is up and running”
    * “There are 3-4 clicks in eBen to even get to this, and then have to drill another level to see available letters. But I like the simplicity that I have all my letters on one page, i can just click on the dropdown and download it, instead of having to click down 3-4 levels to get what I need."
* People really liked the look and feel of the site, its simplicity and ease of use.
* People found the language to be descriptive for the most part
* Navigating the page was intuitive
* At least one participant was surprised by what was available: "Commissary Letter is surprising, it's awesome, but it's surprising. Drug Coverage sort of surprising. The rest of them make sense to me."

The meh: 

* The address is a big blind spot. Every user had to be directed to it.
    * Most understood what would happen if they clicked on “change your address” 
    * At least one would not continue to download a letter if her address was wrong
* There were definite labeling and language issues, where the titles of the different letters weren’t clear about what would be contained. This was mitigated a little bit by the explanation text, but there’s a risk here that people won’t click on a title that doesn’t match their mental model of the letter they’re looking for.

The bad:

* All but one participant expected to be able to access their DD-214 on this site, even though those links are visually distinct from the letters UI. 
* Particularly bad language that caused confusion: BSL 

Changes suggested as a result:

* Relatively minor: we may flip the address and letters sections of the UI. This may also help relieve some of the DD-214 confusion, since it will break up the visual hierarchy of the page
* On the Benefits Summary Letter, we may move the IRIS warning text as its placement caused a tiny bit of confusion
* We should have a larger conversation about the letter titles and if there’s any way to make them more descriptive without messing up people’s business processes
