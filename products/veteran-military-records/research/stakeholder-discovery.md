# Download VA Letters Stakeholder Discovery

## POCs
- Contact center
- Business Owner

## Analytics
- Is there any data on how often users deselect Benefits Summary options, vs how often they proceed w/all checked?

## Discovery
- What have you learned since launching downloadable letters?
- What would you change if you were to do it again today?
- What are some challenges you deal with today, are they different from the challenges pre-downlodable letters?
- What VA processes are affected by/reliant upon this feature, how?

## Granular Design Questions
- Why these 9 letters? Can/should we include other letters?
- Does the address need to appear on the letter itself?
- Why is this called VA Letters? We notice some letters aren't included, and at least one option is a Card as opposed to a Letter
- The options included in the Benefits Summary letter seem to simple in some of the other letters. What information is missing from these options that is included in other letters?
