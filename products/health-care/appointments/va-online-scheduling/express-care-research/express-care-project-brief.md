## Overview: 
We need to understand when, why, and how a Veteran seeks care that they deem "urgent" "immediate" and "now" through VA digital channels. We specifically want to understand:
 + when do Veterans seek "urgent" "immediate" "same day" care
 + what types of care do Veterans seek "urgent" "immediate" "same day" care / how do they define same day care
 + would Veterans use an online method for receiving same day care

## Problem Statement:
Some Veterans have a care need right now that requires immediate medical attention or guidance. For various reasons, the Veteran may not be able to go into a physical location for this care. Additionally, their care need may not require an in person visit. In both cases, however, the Veteran needs to talk to a medicial professional _today_. 

Currently, "Express Care" is a vehicle by which the VA can provide immediate, same day evaluation via VA Video Connect (or telehealth). 

Additionally, given the recent COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to give Veterans fast access to care and evaluation via telehealth either as an alternative to in office, face-to-face visits or as a mechanism for screening patients who suspect they have COVID-19. 

This problem may be a subset to a larger problem statement - Veterans have various types of care services which can make it difficult to understand what kind of care to access and how to access it. 

## Goal:
We want to perform user research with various Veterans to collect insights and data on what types of care Veterans would seek same-day telehealth care and how they would go about receiving this immediate, telehealth care at the VA. 

## Current Hypothesis:
We believe the existing vehicle for delivering this same day care "Express Care" online is a separate flow from VA Online Schedule because urgent online consultation/care is same day and not future facing like VA Online Scheduling. 

Flow could be surfaced/launched from our VAOS "view your appointments" landing page, but there may be a better entry point. What would that entry point be?

## Research Questions:
 + _Add questions here to supplement Research Plan_
 + How doe Veterans define Express Care, 
 + Why/when do Veterans seek it out express care
 + Where would Veterans look to schedule/access this type of same day care
 + Are Veterans willing/able to use online methods for same day care
 + What type of devices/platforms have Veterans used to receive similar type of access (if at all?)
