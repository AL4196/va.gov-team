# Express Care Project Brief

## Overview
Veterans have medical needs that may either be resolved without an in-person appointment and/or want guidance about how to seek additional care for a medical concern, yet may not warrant a trip to the ER. For various reasons, the Veteran may not be able to go into a physical location for this care. In both cases, however, the Veteran needs to talk to a medical professional,  today.

"Express Care" is a solution developed by VA (launched in 2017) for immediate, same day phone call triage by a VA scheduler in order to determine next course of action, either phone call follow up by a Veteran's PACT, VA Video Connect visit(VA's proprietary Telehealth platform), scheduling of a non-urgent appointment, or no further action. However, Express Care is not utilized by VA providers, and as a result cannot be used by Veteran patients. 

Due to Express Care being unused, research needs to be conducted to better understand Veterans needs when seeking urgent, same day medical appointments, virtually. Also, Veterans have access to numerous types of care options/"products" which can make it difficult to understand which type of care to select and how to access it. This is especially true when considering the different VA digital access points to accessing care.

Additionally, with the recent the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., there is an even more pressing need to provide Veterans with the option to get fast, safe access to care and evaluation via Telehealth either as an alternative to in office, face-to-face visits or as a COVID-19 screening resource. The VAOS team believes Express Care can serve as a tool to facilitate immediate access to remote medical care as well as provide VA providers a remote mechanism for screening patients who are concerned they have COVID-19.

## Problem Statement:
As a Veteran with an urgent medical concern, I need access to a Telehealth appointment with a VA medical provider *today*. 

As a Veteran getting medical care from the VA, I don't think there is an urgent Telehealth option available to me.

As a Veteran with a medical concern, I need access to a Telehealth appointment with my VA medical provider *today*, but I am concerned about being seen in-person because of coronavirus.

***COVID-19 is creating hot spots throughout the country. These hot spots put a strain on VA medical facilities and staff as they try and field calls and screen patients.***

As a Veteran who lives in a geographical COVID-19 hot spot, I need to be provided a way get immediate COVID-19 screening and evaluation from my VA doctor/PACT team. 

As a VA facility located in a COVID-19 hot spot, I need to be able to screen and evaluate VA patients through a digital medium so that I can limit exposure of VA staff and patients to potential COVID-19 cases and/or alleviate need for in-person evaluation this is creating operational bottlenecks. I want to do this by PACT.

### Out of scope problem statements

As the VA, the business rules created that dictate availability of Express Care scheduling prevent Veterans from utilizing  this platform as a viable scheduling option.

As a VA medical provider, the business rules that dictate scheduling for Express Care prevent me from using the platform as a way to treat my patients. 

## Goal:
We want to perform usability research with Veterans to learn more about:
- Veterans understanding of what appointment types are available to them through VA, specifically for telemedicine and same-day appointments
- How might Veterans seek same-day care (either through VA or other sources)
- How might Veterans go about receiving immediate care at the VA, with emphasis on understanding use of 'Telehealth' or online care options.
- Understand how Veterans would seek out immediate COVID-19 evaluation/care
- Understand how VA can provide immediate, digital evaluation for COVID-19 (Currently believe existing Express Care/VAR resources services can help create user flow needed for immediate COVID-19 redirection)
- What's possible with existing Express Care and VAR resources to solve for user and VA needs
- Develop solution that appropriately directs veterans to right care/screening for COVID-19 within VAOS for hot spots

## Current Hypothesis:
We believe there are two major hinderances to Express Care as a service for urgent/same-day appointments for Veteran patients:
- Veterans are completely unaware of Express Care as an option for getting care, due to appointment unavailability from providers.
- Veterans don't think to make an Express Care appointment the same way as other types of VA appointments because of the timeliness of the appointment. Veterans won't think to schedule an Express Care appointment in VAOS the same way they would another appointment type.

As a result, we also believe if VA turns on Express Care, Veterans will not know they can use it as a same-day resource for same-day, virtual COVID-19 screening appointments. 

**For the purpose of this usability research, we aim to focus largely on solving for what circumstances Veterans would use an Express Care appointment and how they would make an appointment.**

We believe the existing option for same day care, "Express Care" online, is overlooked by VA patients as an option for recieving care because of how appointment scheduling online is facilitated through VA Online Schedule. Due to the nature of Express Care being urgent online consultation/care is same day and not future facing like VA Online Scheduling, it needs to exist outside of the VAOS ecosystem. 

For example, the flow could be surfaced/launched from our VAOS "view your appointments" landing page, but there may be a better entry point. What might that entry point be?

## Research Questions:
- Do Veterans consider "same-day" care the same thing as scheduling an appointment? If not, how is this different?
- What medical problems/types of appointments do Veterans consider using Telehealth appointments for?
- How do Veterans define "Express Care"? Is it Telehealth or in-person?
- How do Veterans seek same-day / urgent care virtually? Can they do this currently through the VA?
- What type of devices/platforms do Veterans use for video chats (if at all)?
- Are Veterans comfortable getting medical advice via Telehealth? If so, what for? If not, why?
- What VA health care resources are Veterans aware of related to COVID-19?
- Will Veterans use a VA online COVID-19 screening tool?
- Will Veterans choose Express Care for COVID-19 screening?
- When do Veterans think COVID-19 Express Care appointments be available to them?

## Timeline:
- ***UNDETERMINED as of 4/15/2020. Next steps: have researched/tested options for rapid implementation within legacy VAOS on directing Veterans to immediate screening and/or care due to COVID-19***

 + Notes from Get Care research:
   + Veterans prefer face to face interactions
   + Veterans are not aware of online services
   + Veterans trust online services promoted/used by their primarcy care provider, however, there was expressed hesitancy associated with new technology. Veterans expressed first interaction with tech key and Veteran willingness to try if it can help their provider. 
  + Veterans are calling for items that could be handled online
  + Missed appointments high
  + High call volumes at call centers
  + High appointment request volume
  + Multiple tools exist to accomplish same tasks
  + Some VHA resources are _overutilized_ (e.g. call center volume)
