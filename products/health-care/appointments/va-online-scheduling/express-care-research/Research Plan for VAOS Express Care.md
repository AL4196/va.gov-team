# Research Plan for VAOS Express Care Discovery
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?

   Express Care is a product VA developed in 2017 to provide virtual same day appointments to Veterans. However, this product is not currently in use by VA providers and believed to be unknown to Veterans as an option for receiving care. 

   For this study, we are specifically focused on learning from Veterans about their behavior for seeking "urgent", "immediate", and "same day" care from VA health care providers, what type of care Veterans seek in this format, how Veterans define same day appointments, and how Veterans would go about getting (making an appointment/request) this type of care in order to support VA's efforts to provide Veterans with fast, safe access to care and evaluation for COVID-19 via Telehealth.

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

   Veterans have medical needs that may either be resolved without an in-person appointment and/or want guidance about how seek additional care for a medical concern, yet may not demand a trip to the ER. For various reasons, the Veteran may not be able to go into a physical location for this care. In both cases, however, the Veteran needs to talk to a medical professional *today*.

   "Express Care" was a care option developed by VA for immediate, same day evaluation via VA Video Connect (VA's proprietary Telehealth platform). However, Express Care is not utilized by VA providers, and as a result not used by Veteran patients. We believe the business rules in place prevent this platform from being a preferred option by providers and patients, alike.

   This problem may also be a subset to a larger problem statement--Veterans have access to various types of care which can make it difficult to understand what kind of care to access and how to access it. This is especially true when considering the different VA digital access points to accessing care.

   Additionally, with the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to give Veterans fast, safe access to care and evaluation via Telehealth either as an alternative to in office, face-to-face visits. The VAOS team believes Express Care can serve as a tool to facilitate immediate access to remote medical care as well as provide VA providers a remote mechanism for screening patients who suspect they have COVID-19.	

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

   - What resources VA health care resources are Veterans aware of related to COVID-19?
   - Will Veterans choose Express Care for COVID-19 screening?
   - Will Veterans use a VA online COVID-19 screening tool?
   - When do Veterans think COVID-19 Express Care appointments be available to them?
   - How do Veterans seek same-day / urgent care virtually?
   - How do Veterans define "Express Care"? Is it Telehealth or in-person?
   - Do Veterans consider "same-day" care the same thing as scheduling an appointment? If not, how is this different?
   - What types of appointments do Veterans consider using Telehealth appointments for? 
   - What type of devices/platforms do Veterans use for video chats (if at all)?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

    + Veterans are completely unaware of Express Care as an option for getting care, due to appointment unavailability from providers.
    + As a result of being unaware of Express Care, if VA turns on Express Care, Veterans will not know they can use it as a same-day resource for COVID-19 screening.
## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  
  - Remote moderated usability research and usability testing mid-fidelity prototypes.
  
2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

   - We need to learn from Veterans what their mental model of scheduling and same-day medical / Telehealth from VA is, with a focus on COVID-19 screening.
   - We need to validate our hypotheses about Veterans perception of scheduling an Express Care appointment.
   - We need to validate our design recommendations for a COVID-19 screener resource.

3. Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*	

   Zoom?

4. What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	

   A/B testing InVision prototype and Express Care on VAOS

5. If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)

   Zoom?	
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	
  (Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)
  - Veterans who CURRENTLY USE VA health care
  - Veterans who currently have experience with the VA Online Scheduling tool
  - Veterans who can be on an iPad or Laptop with Zoom enabled
  - Veterans who are interested in / have sought out same day medical / Telehealth appointments either from VA or another medical provider
2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
Perigean
## When? 	
1. Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
  (IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 

  April 6, 7, 8, 9 (or sooner, ideally)	

2. **Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)** 

   â€‹	

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours) 	

   1 hour

4. Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.
