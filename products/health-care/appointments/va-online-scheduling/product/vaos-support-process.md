## Help Desk Support for VAOS- R

Support process previously used for VAOS will continue with VAOS-R on VA.gov, even as part of the transition of VAOS-R to the VA.gov team. The escalation will flow this pathway:
+ HRC will continue to be first point of contact -- Silvia Palmer POC
  ++ HRC create origin ticket in JIRA
  ++ HRC will work with the user to resolve issue; if issue resolved, close ticket @ Call Center
  ++ if issue cannot be resolve escalate to MSD
+ Mobile Service Desk (MSD) will continue to be second point of contact
    -- Receive unsolved issue from HRC
    -- MSD trys to replicate issue and opens issue in JIRA
    -- MSD verifies if issue is backend or frontend issues
    -- If backend issue MSD will esclate to MACM/Dev Team
    -- IF frontend issue, will handover JIRA ticket to VAOS/VA.gov in...?
    -- Will escalate to MACM or Dev team if needed
 - VAOS/VA.gov Platform teams will serve as both third point of contact or concurrently reviewing/addressing issues discovered via our monitoring platforms (Sentry, Grafana, Google Analytics)
    -- Issues tracked via GitHub issues
    -- VAOS/VA.gov will absorb tickets/issues from MDS and HRC via JIRA
    -- VAOS/VA.gov will convert JIRA into trackable issues in Github and assign to appropriate team
    -- 

Tickets/issues will be marked with:
  - Low, Medium, High, Urgent
  - Issues will maintain current SLAs
    -- MDS SLAs:
