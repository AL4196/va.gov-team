# Scheduling clerk questions

-1 What information do you see from the VAOS request? Of that information, what do you use? What is helpful?

Do you use the AM vs PM preference when you call Veterans back?

Does the “Purpose of visit” (e.g. Routine/follow up, New issue. Medication concern) inform the appointment in direct scheduling?

What other information might be helpful that is currently NOT being collected in VAOS appt requests?

How are clinics differentiated from each other?

Some users see long lists of clinics when direct scheduling appointments in VAOS. Why do they see so many? 

If you could change anything about what VAOS tells you about the Request (anything at all) what would it be?

Express care—how is it tracked? Are there stop codes associated with it? Are stop codes assigned to the appointment after a scheduling clerk speaks to the Veteran?
