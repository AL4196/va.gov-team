## VEText

This folder is for all documents and work related to VEText, which is a appointment reminder system built in the Loma Linda Medical Center. 

VEText texts Veterans to remind them of upcoming appointments and also has the ability to allow Veterans to automatically cancel appointments by replying to the message. This system has shown to reduce missed appointments, which helps make hospitals more efficient and allows more patients to be seen. 

As of October 2017, VEText is in use in 4 medical centers;  Loma Linda, Fayetteville NC, San Diego and Tampa.  

The primary points of contact for VEText itself are Shane Elliott (shane.elliott@va.gov) and Rob Durkin (Robert.Durkin@va.gov). 
DSVA team members involved in this project: Alex Loehr, Marvo Dolor, Charles Worthington, Chris Johnston, and Aaron Wieczorek.

**To get oriented you might want to start with a slide deck that summarizes the project (aimed at VA Leadership) [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Health%20care/Scheduling/Appointment%20Reminders/VEText/Working%20Drafts/2017-12-1%20Draftv4%20VEText.pptx).**
