# Debt Letters Pre-discovery: Melissa Rebstock
## Agenda:

#### Attendees: 
Matthew Self, Leah Keeler, Riley Orr, Amen Ra, Mahariel Rosario, Melissa Rebstock, Cameron Testerman

#### Background:
The Benefits & Memorials 2 team is working on a solution that allows Veterans to more quickly and easily understand if and why they may have debts with the VA, and how to work with the VA to resolve them. 

#### Purpose:
We are meeting today so the team can meet Melissa Rebstock, VEO Executive Partner. The main goal is to learn about her background around the initiative and her thoughts around potential solutions. 

### Notes: 

**Matt: Can you tell us about your background?** <br>
- Chief of the customer-facing solutions team under customer information services team under multi-channel… under VEO
- Most of projects managed are front-end facing systems, customer-facing systems; been working on eBenefits since 2009
- Involvement in this project started 2 years ago to see how to get debt letters and electronic notifications online 
- Couldn’t implement changes to eBenefits because of development funds and were told to halt project 
- Project goes beyond adding letters and notifications; Congress has asked VA to integrate debt management system into a single system 
   - Want same common language, more clear to understand, user friendly 
   - Congress wants a quick win:
     - Put letters online (functionality exists)
     - Electronic alerts 
- eBenefits does have “My Documents” to display documents from eFolder, but they don’t want to put on eBenefits because it’s being sunsetted 
- Debt Management Center wants to display 5 letter types, but they end up being 30 different letters 
- "We’re trying to get DMC to tell us which letters they want, can potentially display 30 but we are unsure"
- There needs to be discussion around implementing ability to opt-in to receive electronic notifications 
  - Referenced e-pharmacy notification; no one knows what it is, but they think it’s an email notification
- Existing teams working on notifications:
  - VBA is working on electronic notification piece, but we need more info 
  - VHA has appointment text notifications 
  - Pharmacy email piece
- Referenced a document that has all requirements
<br>

**Matt: What improvements do you envision? Pie in the sky!**<br>
- Part of requirement is that DMC has to send out paper notifications 
  - Can see if we can pull a copy of the letter Veteran received 
- Would prefer a self-service tool giving a real-time snapshot
- "If I as a veteran now the VA money and owe it across the organization, maybe we have total amount of debt owed but it expands to break out smaller portions they owe"
- **Reached out to VSOs and were told that from the time debt is originated to paperwork is submitted, Veterans forget why they owe money to the VA**
- MVP: display the letters that have been sent to them 
<br>

**Matt: You said a potential capability is to see the letters. My impression from letter samples is even if you get them on time, they’re confusing. They look alike, etc. From your perspective, does putting the letter as it is gonna be clear?**<br>
- No. If we take the letters as they are and put them out for veterans to see then we’re meeting the law, but it won’t help the Veteran at all. Over the last year DMC has done focus groups and they had recommendations to change the letters. They said these are more clear, these are great, how to implement changes. DMC could not implement the changes. They have templates, but they can’t technically implement them. 
- Limitations had to do with: 
   - Callouts to put in color, or do this in a chart, can send this to you. 
   - I had to write up a summary of all this in November and so I can send all that to you. You need to take a look at your spacing, it’s just a computer-generated letter that is single space. The only callout has 5 extra spaces before and after. 
<br>

**Matt: From your perspective, is clarifying the letters in some fashion a key portion of this project. Or if we throw the letters in as is knowing that it’s not helpful; is that a dealbreaker?**<br>
- I think from a VA perspective the law just says to put the letters online. Not even addressing the functionality or helpfulness. To expand and meet the purpose of the law, we’d want to change that. 
- Maybe we have two things: Letters out there and then self-service screenshot to get that information. 
<br>

**Matt: No one wants to read a letter. I think that makes a lot of sense. It’s a lot of content if we’re talking 5 letters with x numbers of variations, maybe it’s not 30, but 5 is a lot of content. We have content writers that can assist, but my immediate question becomes: how difficult do you imagine content change process to be? There’s always back and forth but getting to a final draft can be a nightmare. Do you think that’s a possibility with this stakeholder group or too high of a hurdle?**<br>
- The only stakeholder is Jason from DMC. It won’t be expanded, it’s just gonna be Jason and his team. That said, this is where we talked about content. **Five letters are there, but there’s the potential that there’s 30.** We have 5 letters, variations for the business line. We have a base template but then 4 other variations. Can we see all 30 of the letters and do an analysis to see consistency? I haven’t seen that. 
<br>

**Matt: Are the letters wildly different?**<br>
- Jason only gave me five letters. But there are 30-40 letters 
<br>

**Matt: Do you know who owns the content?**<br>
- High level process, at least from compensation service perspective, a veteran is married & gets divorced & doesn’t tell us. Two years later he lets us know and we update it but there’s overpayment. He will then get notification letters from DMC about how to pay debt. It would be created on VBA side and goes over to DMC and then DMC sends all the notifications. 
- They’ll get a notification saying “this is a debt you owe for compensation and pension” but they don’t get any context 
<br>

**Are there any other interesting pieces of feedback you got from VSOs?**<br>
- Letters are confusing
- There’s not a lot of information on how to make the payments. A lot of times it’s “We’re going to do this unless you respond in x number of days”
- They’re appealable. You have a year from the decision to appeal it. Confusion around that process 
<br>

**Matt: How are you thinking about the timing of letters going out vs digital solutions? You mentioned a challenge veterans face is they are aware they have debt, but by the time the letter arrives they forget the context. If we’re thinking about having this digital webpage that displays info about a veterans debt, since the letters continue to come out… if someone finds out they have debt through letter or on this page… if they take action before they receive the letter… is it more important to display most recent data or follow letter?**<br>
- We think real time. People are getting checks deposited and then they receive a letter a week later. One, I would think it’s easier to keep it updated in real-time. Two, there’d have to be a disclaimer that the letter is not there. 
- If we can’t do email notifications then we should let them go into a portal to view the letter. Timeliness and accuracy is most important
<br>

**Matt: Is there any thinking you’ve had about allowing people to opt out of receiving physical letters. If someone chooses to just receive electronic notifications, is that allowed?**<br>
- That is up to DMC. I want to say there’s legal requirements with DMC to mail letters. I think we asked that, and we need to confirm with Jason, but I think there’s a legal requirement that they need to mail the letter. VBA is working on electronic notifications. I don’t know if DMC could leverage that or if they’ve gone back to Congress to change the law.

### Key takeaways 
- This initiative is a quick win that will be part of a larger initiative 
- The debt letters are confusing and poorly formatted; potential to work with content team to provide clarity
- Important to display real-time information
- There are multiple teams working on electronic alert initiatives that we could sync with (VBA, VHA, Pharmacy email)
- The DMC conducted research surrounding the letters and created updated templates that could not be implemented 
- VSOs have stated that Veterans forget what the debt letter is for due to amount of time between debt notification and receiving a debt letter 
- 5 letter types with 30-40 letters; have not seen letters to compare 

### Next steps 
- The team needs to uncover different types of electronic notifications 
- Learn about the 5 different letter types & receive the 30-40 letters to compare content 
- Design team will become familiarized with the legal requirements surrounding the initiative
