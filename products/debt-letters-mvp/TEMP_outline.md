# Executive Summary

Thereâ€™s an overarching project called the Veteran Debt Processing Enhancement that was put into place due to several overarching legislative requirements specifically related to Veteran debt.  VA is working on a comprehensive solution across all administrations that encompasses all requirements, to include business process re-engineering and modernization of systems.
As an initial MVP, the DMC is looking to demonstrate forward progress on this initiative by implementing a solution that allows Veterans to more quickly and easily understand if and why they may have debts with the VA, and how to work with the VA to resolve them.

## User Problem Statement
### OPTIONS
- How might we make communications regarding debt accurate, timely, and clear, while treating Veterans with dignity and compassion?
- Veterans who have incurred a debt with the VA need a way to get accurate, timely, and clear information about the reason and status of that debt, along with their options for resolving it, while being treated with dignity and compassion.
- I am a Veteran who has incurred a debt with the VA for one reason or another, and I need to understand why and what my options for resolving it are. Currently, in addition to the information sometimes being inaccurate or out of date, the communications I receive from the VA about debt leave me feeling frustrated and demeaned.
- Those of our Veterans who have incurred a debt with the VA struggle to understand the reason for the debt and what their options are to resolve it because the communications about debt the VA sends are difficult to understand and slow to arrive. Our solution should focus on making all content and communication about debt accurate, timely, clear, and compassionate, so that Veterans can take appropriate action while maintaining their dignity.


## Solution Goals

- TBD
- 

### User Goals
- To have a single place through which I can manage any debts I have with the VA
- To be able to understand all of the communication about any debts I have with the VA
- To be able to understand and access all of the available paths to resolve any debts I have incurred
- To understand ahead of time what benefits and/or set of circumstances might lead to me incurring a debt with the VA
- To know as quickly as possible about changes to my debt status with the VA, to include newly filed debts, and changes to existing debts regardless of the cause of the change
- For the overall experience of handling a debt with the VA be as painless as possible instead of leaving me feeling frustrated and demeaned
- To receive consistently accurate information about the status of my account, regardless of the way in which that communication gets to me

## Hypotheses

- TBD

## Requirements 
### High-Level

- Digital "landing page" explaining the debt management process at the VA
- Veterans can view information about debts they owe the VA in a single place
- Veterans are automatically notified when new communications about debts are available to them, and given a way to navigate directly to the new communication on VA.gov
- Outgoing notifications about debt are configurable
- Veterans can understand the communications they receive from the VA about debts; they are plain-language, adhere to modern design practices, and engage with Veterans in an empathetic way
- Information delivered to Veterans about the status and nature of their debts is accurate and up-to-date

## Constraints

There are two main contraints known at this time, one coming from the business and one from the technical landscape within the VA.

Business: This problem affects Veterans as well as eligible dependents, however due to external pressures from Congress, there is a desire to limit the scope of this problem to indebted Veterans to expedite the process of launching something meaningful to Veterans. It's currently unclear how much wiggle room there is here; it's possible we might be able to address the concerns of non-Veterans without adding complexity to the problem or lengthening the delivery timeline

Technical: There are many different types communications about debt (typically referred to as "debt letters) that are sent out to Veterans. At this time, many of these have yet to be migrated into a central respository and organized in a reliable fashion. Because of this, the scope of this problem is limited to addressing only those letters types which ARE organized and accessible in a central respository (VBMS eFolder)

## API Calls and Dependent Systems

Direct Deposit uses the EVSS PPIU API (https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/wss-ppiu-services-web/rest/ppiuServices/v1) to retrieve and update a veteran's financial information.

We also use the govDelivery API to send emails.
