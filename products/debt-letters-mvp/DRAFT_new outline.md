## Overview
We will give Veterans who have incurred a debt with the VA a place on VA.gov that will act both as a single landing page that explains the process of debt management at the VA, as well as the ability to be notified when new communications about debt are added to their file so they can view them on VA.gov after logging in.

## Problem Statement
Communications about debt, which happens via the mail, are disjointed, sporadic, and untimely, and often times go unread due to a variety of reasons (misplaced, didn’t open, etc.)

Keeping track of physical letters about debt is difficult and time-consuming at best, and fraught with danger at worst.

Veterans don’t have a way to know that new debt letters have been generated until they arrive in the mail, potentially losing valuable time during which they could be taking action to resolve debts

Debt letters are extraordinarily confusing, dense, and display a disappointing lack of empathy toward the Veteran

*Follow your problem description up with a "How might we... _______" statement re-framing that challenge as an opportunity. Don't hint too much at what the solution might be, you should have enough of a focal point here to guide your ideas, but plenty of freedom to think laterally and innovatively as you experiment and prototype later.*
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- *Why would a user want to use this?*
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

## Undesired Business Outcomes

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumtion w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

## KPIs
- *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
