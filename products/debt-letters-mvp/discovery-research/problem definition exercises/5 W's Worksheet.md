Who —
•	Who does the problem affect? (i.e specific groups, organizations, customers)
o	This problem effects primarily Veterans who have incurred debts with the VA, the VA’s Debt Management Center, various call centers across the VA, and Congress
•	Who are our primary/secondary users?
o	Our primary users are Veterans who have incurred a debt with the VA
o	Secondarily, those Veterans who are either currently using or considering making use of a VA benefit which could leave them with a debt
•	Who other than our primary/secondary users might we affect?
o	We could also potentially address similar problems for dependents and other eligible beneficiaries, as they are also able to incur debts with the VA in under certain circumstances
What —
•	What are the boundaries of the problem? (i.e organizational, work flow, geographic, customer, segments)
o	Business: At this time, due to external pressures from Congress, there is a desire to limit the scope of this problem to indebted Veterans; unclear how much wiggle room there is
o	Technical: There are many different types communications about debt that are sent out; at this time, many of these have yet to be migrated into a central respository and organized in a reliable fashion; because of this, the scope of this problem is limited to rethinking the management of those letters types which ARE organized and accessible in a central respository (VBMS eFolder)
•	What is the current issue that require attention?
o	Veterans don’t receive timely, accurate, and clear communications about debts they may owe to the VA, nor do they understand what actions may result in debts or what their options are to resolve them
•	What is the ultimate goal/impact?
o	To give Veterans the information they need to understand and address debts they may owe to the VA while treating them with compassion and respect
•	What are some background information that we need?
o	Some background from “The VA”: There’s an overarching project called the Veteran Debt Processing Enhancement that was put into place due to several overarching legislative requirements specifically related to Veteran debt. VA is working on a comprehensive solution across all administrations that encompasses all requirements, to include business process re-engineering and modernization of systems.  However, this project is intended to demonstrate a quick win within the FY to build momentum for the larger project and appease Congress
•	What does the end goal look like?
o	The end goal of this MVP is to give Veterans an easily accessible place to get clear, accurate, and timely information about debts they may owe to the VA in a respectful manner
•	What would happen if we didn’t solve the problem?
o	Failure to address this problem will mean Veterans will continue to be confused by communications about debt
When —
•	When does this issue occur?
o	Primarily this problem begins to affect Veterans at the moment they incur a debt with the VA, and persists until a resolution of some kind is reached; secondarily, this issue affects those Veterans who are making use of or considering making use of any benefits program which could leave them with a debt
•	When are we looking to plan, organize, ideate, design, prototype and ship?
o	We are currently organizing the team to begin discovery on this project, with a goal of delivering a first-draft roadmap by early March
Where —
•	Where is the issue(problem) occurring?
o	This issue affects Veterans making use of a wide range of benefits and programs offered by the VA
•	Where do we need to focus on the most?
o	That being said, we most need to focus on those Veterans who are receiving communications of the type that are accessible in the technical environment we are operating in
Why —
•	Why is it important that we fix the problem?
o	Inaccurate and confusing information about debts can be catastrophic to Veterans relying on certain benefits from the VA, such as disability compensation
