# The 2020 Better Wayfinding Intiative

This is a cross-team and multi-release initiative to improve user wayfinding on the new VA.gov, in both the unauthenticated and authenticated experiences. In 2019, we hit some limitations with wayfinding on the new VA.gov MVP (launched in Nov. 2018) as we implemented Drupal to power content publishing in the unauth. experience and built and shipped more auth. tools.

## What is wayfinding?

It's how our users find their way around VA.gov. It includes:

- Global navigation and menus
- Product navigation and menus
- Organization of content and sections of the website
- Google/search engine content page deep-linking
- Breadcrumbs and page headings
- UI labels and section headings
- UI content components like cards, tiles, call-outs, and alerts
- Calls to action and links

## What needs to change?

We need to streamline our wayfinding so it's easier for our users to find their way around VA.gov. We still have the same goal: **Get customers to top content and tools in just 1 to 2 clicks.**
