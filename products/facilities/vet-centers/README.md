# VA Vet Center Facility Product

This is the new VA.gov facility product for VA's Vet Centers.

- VHA runs 300 Vet Centers
- Vet Centers are stand-alone facilities; they are not integrated into VAMC health care systems

**Business partner:**

- Jessica Schiefer, VHA Vet Center Communications Officer (Jessica.Schiefer@va.gov)

## What we need to do

- Research, design, and write new content for "Prepare for your visit" section
- Research, design, and write new VHA Vet Center services taxonomy
- Research, design, and write (first draft/pilot) local facility content for each Vet Center service
- Build Vet Center cemetery facilities in Drupal
- Build VHA Vet Center services taxonomy in Drupal, and integrate into the Facilities API
- Build and publish new front-end VA Vet Center facility product
- Research, design, and write new content for new facility products

## Old/legacy Vet Center websites

We need to reach parity with our new Vet Center products so we can turn off all the old sites.

- Vet Center program site: https://www.vetcenter.va.gov/
- Facility Locator facility detail page: https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0201V

Vet Centers do not have their own facility detail pages outside the Faciltiy Locator tool.
