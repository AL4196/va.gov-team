## What we need to do

- Research, design, and write new content for "Prepare for your visit" section
- Research, design, and write new NCA cemetery services taxonomy
- Research, design, and write (first draft/pilot) local facility content for each NCA service
- Build NCA cemetery facilities in Drupal
- Build NCA cemetery services taxonomy in Drupal, and integrate into the Facilities API
- Build and publish new front-end VA National Cemetery facility product
- Research, design, write/or move other content from old sites (e.g., history and education content, PDFs and other files, etc.)

## Old/legacy cemetery websites

We need to reach parity with our new cemetery products so we can turn off all the old sites.
