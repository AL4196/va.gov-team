Present: Dave Conlon, Jenny Heiland-Luedtke, Mikki Northuis, Kevin Walsh

Agenda: 

1. VAMC system names ([https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/naming-schema/meeting-notes/facility-naming-nuances.docx](facility-naming-nuances.docx))
1. VAMC facility naming (do we ever shorten?)

Main outcomes for VAMC system names:

1. There’s lots of legwork to do to figure out the names for all the systems Mikki put in her Nuances doc. Jenny will do that on a VISN by VISN basis
1. VISN 4 is good to go for system names
1. Nothing will go into the Facility API for now, VISN 4 groupings will be handled manually in Drupal, but hopefully Facility API will house the groupings for whatever’s after VISN 4

Main outcomes for facility names
1. JHL is in agreement about full names for H1s and URLs.
1. Decision still needed (i think, right Mikki?) about shortening facility names in left nav and breadcrumb. This will have to be rolled back into the Pittsburgh product.  
1. Jen Lee should weigh in on how to handle facility names in Meta title. Some facility names are longer than 70 characters so will have to be shortened no matter what.
