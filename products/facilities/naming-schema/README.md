# VA Facilities Naming Schema
How we are using official facility names, new customer-freindly names, and new URLs across our digital product ecosystem

> Pay attention to title case vs. sentence case--it's intentional!

## VHA health care facilities schema
This example schema below is for the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System. It represents a **VAMC facility network** (i.e., VAMC is parent facility, with health clinics as children facilities; customers get access to the entire network). It should apply to _most_ VAMC systems.
