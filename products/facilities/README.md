# VA.gov Facilities & Services Product Portfolio

**Product Owner:** Dave Conlon (David.Conlon@va.gov)

## Why VA facilities and services matter to Veterans

- Veterans associate their VA benefits and health care journey with where they go to receive help and care.

- VA facilities humanize VA by demystifying "the VA black box" and by delivering in-person services and support.

- Veterans' mental models for VA benefits and health care start with the task they are trying to complete (e.g., get disabiltiy benefits), the service they are looking for (e.g., career counseling), or the condition they are experiencing (e.g., depression). 

**Why this matters to VA**

VA has a responsibility to provide accurate VA facilities and VA services information to its customers--and that align with the Veteran experience of getting and managing their VA benefits and health care.
