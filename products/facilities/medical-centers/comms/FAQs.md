## General

**What is the VAMC website upgrade project?**
It is a VA digital modernization initiative to provide a better customer experience on the VA.gov website. Research indicated that the old VAMC websites were not meeting the need of users, so we worked to design a new experience that empowers users to get to top content and tools in just a few clicks. A better digital experience should mean fewer phone calls to VAMCs to get basic information or ask for help.

**Why is VA doing this?**
The new VAMC websites are part of VA’s work to execute on the VA Digital Modernization Vision, which includes consolidating and integrating VA’s top web properties (“brands”) into one user experience on the new VA.gov. This helps fulfill the VA CTO’s goal to have VA's online experience match that of a typical Fortune 500 company.

**Why is VA Digital Modernization and VA Web Brand Consolidation so important?**
VA is committed to executing on VA Secretary Wilkie’s number one priority: customer service.

Veterans, family members, caregivers, and service members all told VA the same thing over years of research and feedback sessions: navigating VA’s websites is confusing, there is too much duplicative content, and it’s hard to tell which information is accurate. Providing a best-in-class user experience on the new VA.gov is VA’s answer to making the online experience better meet the needs of Veterans, family members, caregivers, and service members.

**How much research went into the new website design?**
A lot. We conducted research with 900 participants over 9 months. VHA Digital Media partnered with OIT Digital Experience Product Office to research, design, test, and build the new website design with Veterans, family members, caregivers, and patient advocates.

**Is this a content migration project?**
No. We are not automatically moving ("migrating") old VAMC website content into the new VAMC website. Any "old" content that PAOs want to move to the new website will need to manually be moved over and/or re-written.

**Why is there so much less content in the new website design?**
The new website design is focused on top tasks and content that Veterans, families, and caregivers need most. Additionally, website analytics and data for the old websites show that users are mostly looking for health services, facilitiy services, contact information, and appointments and pharamcy information--all parts of the new website that have been prioritized in the design.

**Do we get to keep our old VAMC website URL/subdomain?**
Yes. Your old subdomain will automatically redirect to your new VA.gov URL.

Example: pittsburgh.va.gov will redirect to va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care

We currently have no plans for these redirects to expire.

**Will the website URLs go to a 404 error when users go to an old URL?**
No. We built page redirects, so any URLs from the old website will go to the new website's homepage.

Example: p
Users also get an “onboarding” modal/pop-up that lets them know that Explore.VA.gov has been retired and that they can now find everything they need on the new VA.gov.

Yes. You should prioritize removing and updating retired URLs in any materials that you print. You should update all your materials to point customers to new VA.gov URLs.
