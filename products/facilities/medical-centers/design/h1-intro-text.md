# Standardized H1s and Intro Text
Here's an overview of how we are standardizing page H1s and intro text in the VAMC product.

- Each level corresponds with the product sitemap: https://app.moqups.com/Rnc4BDEKrA/view/page/a9e1a59e9)
- Every new VAMC product should use the **exact copy below**
  - Replace the systems short name (in brackets) and any local references
- If a page is not included below, then it doesn't need to use standardized H1s and intro text 

## Level 1
**/pittsburgh-health-care**
- **H1:** [VA Pittsburgh health care]
- **Intro text:** VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System proudly serves Veterans, their families and caregivers. Your needs guide our experienced health care providers. We make it easy for you to manage your health care online, find a VA health care facility near you, and sign up for community events and updates.
> Notes: If the VAMC has an official system name, use it in the intro text. If not, repeat the system short name.
