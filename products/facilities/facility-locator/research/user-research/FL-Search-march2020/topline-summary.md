This topline summary is a result of the synthesis that happens after conducting/observing research sessions. This is a high level summary of trends and analysis, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

## Research Questions & Answers
**How does user interaction with the map and search results differ between urban and rural residents?**
 - Urban residents were more likely to scroll through results as they received more listings
 - Rural residents interacted with the top few listings shown and expected that other listings would be too far away
 - Most participants expected their main VA Medical Center to be one of the top three listings
 - Urban users wanted to interact with a smaller area on the map than Rural veterans 
 
**What impact does facility or service type have on how participants interact with search results?**
 - When participants were prompted to look for a facility that could assist with home loan help, their locations were all far away from the location they input. This caused users to seek a different way to access that information, or drop the task altogether
 - Participants expressed a general lack of trust when it comes to VA-adjacent locations and would often scroll past clinics and non-VA locations to find VAMCs or similar locations.
 - Participants stated that they would expect to see between 3 and 5 health-related locations and only 1-2 benefits-related locations listed in the search results

**How many search results should the facility locator display before pagination?**
 - Rural participants mentioned wanting to see 2 or 3 locations listed on a page
 - Urban participants wanted to see 5 or more locations listed on a page
 - Recommendation: show 5 results before pagination

**How do participants utilize the map and search results together?**
 - All participants referenced the search results first before making note of the map
 - Participants used the search results to scan locations by distance
 - Participants used the map to look at exact the location of a facility
 - Participants also used the map as a secondary way to see how many facilities were a reasonable distance from their location

**How do particpants expect to refine their search results?**
 - Participants hesitated to choose a service type and primarily defaulted to facility type
 - No participants looked for a filter to refine their search further than the given dropdowns

## Hypotheses & Answers
**Rural participants will not want to see many return results if the facilities are far away**
 - True
 - Rural participants all mentioned only wanting to see 2 to 3 results. They assumed anything else would be too far.
 > "37 miles is too far. I wouldn't drive that far to see my mother..."
 
**Urban participants will want to see multiple locations and compare them by if they are close**
 - True
 - All urban participants expected to see a long list of locations that are close to them (within ~10) miles
 - VA locations were prioritized over other locations and distance came second to that
 

**Users will be looking for VAMC or VA locations first regarding healthcare related searches**
 - True
 - Participants usually scrolled past non-VA locations or smaller clinics and mentioned that they were looking for a VAMC or similar
 - Most participants mentioned lacking trust in a seamless process with non-VA locations
 > "I don't have a sense of trust with the VA and going somewhere else, and having it be seamless and easy to do. I'd of course be attracted to the idea of going to something closer than the medical center, but I'd be worried that there'd be an issue with getting the VA to pay for it, so I would default to going to the medical center to be sure there wouldn't be any problems."

**Rural participants may depend on landmarks and they may recognize non-VA locations easier**
 - Unsolved
 -

## Other Findings
**Participants most common used the Facility Locator when traveling or moving to an unfamiliar area**
- Details
> “Sample quote if relevent”

**People are more likely to utilize the Facility Locator to research locations**
- True
- Participants want to use the tool to scope out the offerings in an unfamiliar area
- Participants did not use the Facility Locator for task-based prompts
- Most participants mentioned that they only used the tool once: either when moving to a new location or traveling to an unfamiliar area
> “Sample quote if relevent”

**Expected results for map depends on geographic location**
- Rural participants mentioned that they wanted to only see the top 3-4 locations near them as anything outside of that would be too far to travel
- Urban participants expected to see a smaller radius on the map but with far more location pins to compare
> “Sample quote if relevent”

**Distance and travel time vary by location**
