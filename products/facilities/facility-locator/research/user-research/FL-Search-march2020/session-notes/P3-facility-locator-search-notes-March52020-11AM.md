## Introduction

**Moderator: Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding locations on the VA website. Before we start, a few things I want to mention:**

- This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

**Participant:** I'm comfortable with it.

## Warm up questions

**Moderator: Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions. Tell me about your service history.**

**Participant:** Been in the Army from sept 1 1981 - aug 7 2984.  I got an honorable discharge because I couldn't adapt to military lifestyle. I had a lot of problems after my wife died. 

**Moderator: As i mentioned we'll be looking at the VA website. How often do you visit the VA website?**

**Participant:** On average at least once a week.

**Moderator: What are you normally doing?

P: Checking re-fills and lab results

**Moderator: Have you ever used the facility locator on the VA website?**

**Participant:** No I have not

M: I'm going to send you a link and we'll be talking about how to find VA locations. Let me know if you can see that in the zoom chat. If you can click on that and share your screen wtih me so I can see what you're seeing.  (Explaining how to share screen) And if you could pull up VA.gov

P:Okay 

## Task 1 - Find Facility Locator

**Moderator: I'm going to send you a link to the VA website. Once you have it pulled up, will you share you screen with me? I will be asking you to complete a few tasks. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions.**

**Participant:** Okay. 

**Moderator: - You've come to the VA website because you need help applying for benefits and want to see someone in person at a VA facility. Show us how you would do that.**

**Participant:** Yeah. Uhhh I would go to disability, file for disability

**Moderator: Why would you go there?

**Participant:** It seems like he most logical place to go?

## Task 2 - Review results

**Moderator: Could you show me how you would apply for diability? You could show me what you would do.**

**Participant:** Uhhh, apply for VA healthcare?

**Moderator: If you scroll up you'll see a link to facility locator.

**Participant:** Ohh I wasn't even looking up there.

**Moderator: What would you expect that to be for?

**Participant:** What would I expect that to be for? to look for va locations closest to me?

**Moderator: Could you walk me through how you might use it?

**Participant:** Type in [redacted], va health, services, click on search

**Moderator: Why would you choose VA health?

**Participant:** It just seems like that's where I'm going to see someone, to me that means I'd have to talk to a doctor, and they are the ones that would help fill out the paperwork.

**Moderator: Go ahead and show me what you would do to complete the search in find location

**Participant:** I'd go to a different location

**Moderator: Go ahead and look through these serach results and tell me your thoughts

**Participant:** I'd go to [redacted] VA administration medical center becasue ive been getting care there stince the 90s.  I hate to go somepleace I'm not familiar with. 


## Task 3 - Start new search

**Moderator: Great! I'm going to give you another scenario: You have a sore throat and want to find a community clinic that provides urgent care for Veterans close to your house. Show us what you would do to find this.**

**Participant:** Uhhh well, I'd go back to find VA locations. And then dive back in and see what was close on there. And it gives me 13 results of va healthcare near [redacted]. And... Uh.. Let me look through them all... And actually they have a VA health clinic at [redacted] it's a landmark center. But I'd still go to [redacted] VA medical because it's closer to me. 

**Moderator: Say you're looking for a community medical center What would you do then?

**Participant:** I would go to the (landmark center)

## Follow up

**Moderator: How many results do you want to see after you search?**

**Participant:** I would expect to see 2-3... it says i have 13 for [redacted]

**Moderator: How would you choose which facility you want to visit

**Participant:** I'd go to VA administration medical center, i'm old fashioned. I believe in going to places I trust and I've been to before.

**Moderator: I see, I get that.

**Participant:** How would you figure out what you need to prepare for a visit?

**Participant:** I'd click on the site to see what services they have.

**Moderator: What would you be looking for on this page?

**Participant:** Uhhh, I guess I'd have to go through primary care

**Moderator: I know you said you'd like to see 2-3 results, can you tell me more about that?

**Participant:** I'd like to have a few options.

**Moderator: I noticed you mentioned [redacted] medical clinic is .5 miles away, but you mentioned you'd go to the VA medical center, which is 1.7.  Why would you go to VA medical center over [redacted] medical clinic? 

**Participant:** I'd like to see at least 25 miles, as it is I have to drive 55 miles from here to [redacted] for my primary care.  Now they have a clinic in [redacted] which is only 15 miles away, but they don't have everything that VA has. 

**Moderator:  So how far away would you say this medical center is from your house?

**Participant:**  Uh Which one?

**Moderator: The ones that is 1.7 miles away.

**Participant:**Uh what about it again?

**Moderator: How for would you say it is from your house?

**Participant:** Uh lets' see... maybe 5 minutes...

**Moderator: Okay, so if you were, maybe lets say you were feeling really under the weather and you didn't want to travel that far and you wanted to find urgent care close to your house.

**Participant:** Well I would .... I would want something that I could get into quicker.  The va has an emergency room that I've been to several times and I've gotten great care there, so I'd trust them over all of the others.

**Moderator: If you could look at the map - I noticed you haven't really interacted with that. Could you tell me what area you'd want to see from your input?

**Participant:** I see quite a bit, I'd like to see something close to the VA - because I'm familiar with it, I know the people there and I trust the care.

**Moderator: Do you use any sort of map applications?

**Participant:**  I have a garmin GPS.

**Moderator: Got it, What kind of device do you normally use?

**Participant:** I use my computer, tablet or laptop. 

**Moderator: What kind of devices would you use to use a tool liek this?

**Participant:** I'd use my computer

**Moderator: Great.  Umm, let's see. If you could could you scroll back up to the top? And then could you click on the VA health dropdown under choose a facility type?

**Participant:** Yes.

**Moderator: To the left of that one. 

**Participant:** Oh, I found it I'm sorry.

**Moderator: You're fine. Can we talk through these options that show up? I'd love to get your impression on what you think these mean?

**Participant:** Providers on VA networks. to me that means satellite offices of the VA system, which I would go to if I was near there. 

**Moderator: Got it. And then what about the other options? What do you think those are for?

**Participant:** Urgent care, that would be like if I was sick with the flu and I needed help I would go someplace that has urgent care.  VA health, I would consider like primary care doctors at a va facility. Community providers, that would be satellite offices.  VA benefits I know they help ... but I know I'd have to go to the vet administration office in downtown [redacted], paying for va cemetaries and I've never used that center in [redacted]. 

**Moderator: Okay great. 

## Closing

**Moderator: Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. Do you have any questions for me?

**Participant:** No.

**Moderator: Okay, thank you! Enjoy the rest of your day!**
