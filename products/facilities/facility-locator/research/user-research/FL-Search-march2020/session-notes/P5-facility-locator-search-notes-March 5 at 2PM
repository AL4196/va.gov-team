## Introduction

**Moderator: Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding locations on the VA website. Before we start, a few things I want to mention:**

- This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

**Participant:** That's fine

## Warm up questions

**Moderator: Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions. Tell me about your service history.**

**Participant:** Yes ma'am, I care for my 96 yr old veteran father.

**Moderator: How often do you visit the VA website?**

**Participant:** Yes, umm I do the caregiver more than va, but that's under va right? I visit a couple times a week.

**Moderator: Have you ever used the facility locator on the VA website?**

**Participant:** I like to see what topics they have for caregivers.

**Moderator: Tell me about a time you used the facility locator? What did you use it for?**

**Participant:** I was looking to see which facilities have community living centers connected to hospitals. 

**Moderator:Got it. Can you tell me where you are located?

**Participant:** West Palm Beach, Florida

## Task 1 - Find Facility Locator

**Moderator: I'm going to send you a link to the VA website. Once you have it pulled up, will you share you screen with me? I will be asking you to complete a few tasks. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions.**

**Participant:** Okay

**Moderator: You have a question about your dads benefits and want to talk to someone in person about it, how would you do that?

**Participant:** Send a message through secure messaging and I would ask for an appointment to talk.

**Moderator: I see, got it. Okay. Let's say you want to find the phone number for a specific facility.

I'd go to va.gov.  right here find a location.  I'd put in my zip code or my town, if I wanted to go to las vegas which I did for thanksgiving, I would type in las vegas and then I'd go to search.  Want me to do it?

**Moderator: Yes.

**Participant:**  I'd find the zipcode where I'm living and find the closest zbox to where I"m living.  I htink it was this one. No this one.

**Moderator: Okay, so what was the scenario for you to have to visit that location in las vegas?

**Participant:**  I was there for thanksgiving, I set up an appt.  We were supposed to be there for 2 weeks, and if he needed anything he'd have enrollment at that VA.

**Moderator: You mentioned that you put the zipcode in.  Can you show me which one you chose?

**Participant:** I think it was this one.

**Moderator:  Do you remember why you chose that one?

**Participant:** It was the closest location to her home.

**Moderator: What information where you looking for about that location?

**Participant:** Just in case we needed something for my dad while we were there.

**Moderator: If you could go back one page to those results.  Let's say that you had an appt at your local va facility and you wanted to find their number. How would you do that on here?

**Participant:** I would look - it's on the page.

**Moderator: Can you walk me through that?

**Participant:** Actually it's in my phone already, but....(typing).... number is right there.

**Moderator: You've come to the VA website because you need help applying for a VA Home Loan and want to talk to someone at a VA facility. Show us how you would do that.**

**Participant:** Benefits... lets see...home loan. I'd probably google it. 

**Moderator: And if you wanted to talk to someone regarding that benefit?

**Participant:**  I would go to building 10 and inquire at the benefits office. Or I'd go to the veterans service organization and ask for information through them.

## Task 2 - Review results

**Moderator: Great! I'm going to give you another scenario: You have a sore throat and want to find a community clinic that provides urgent care for Veterans close to your house. Show us what you would do to find this.**

**Participant:** Community Providers... Um. (typing) Done

**Moderator: And why would you choose community providers?

**Participant:** You said to choose someone in the local community, normally I'd call the va and go to the va.

**Moderator: Okay, got it. If you were looking for community care and you see these results here on the left?

**Moderator: How many results do you want to see after you search?**

**Participant:** Around 5.  But nothing is that close. Well I guess 4 miles is kind of close.

**Moderator: How far away would be ideal for you?

**Participant:** 4 miles is okay. But I think there are ones that are closer that are not in the providers list.

**Moderator: If you could click the dropdown and select urgent care, and I'd like to talk to you aboout what shows up here.  Do you know that your local va provides urgentcare?

**Participant:** Yes ma'am, but he has medical and supplemental so we dont have to worry about it.

**Moderator: If you could change the service type to urgent care.  Could you talk me throught if that makes sense to you?

**Participant:** Sure does, it's easy. For some reason it's spinning now. (gets out of main page and has to start over)

**Moderator: Again just a reminder, the scenario is that you're looking for urgent care as quickly as possible.

**Participant:** I'm out of the homepage... I can't find it now.  How would I find that?

**Moderator: How would you do that?

**Participant:** I don't know how to do that.  This is really a lot of information on one screen.  Oh, community care. And then I'd click until I found what I needed.

**Moderator: If you could get back to find a va location, we can get back to the page we were one.  Okay, so can you click on choose facility type dropdown. Can you talk me through what you think these options mean?

**Participant:** VA Health - what VA provides, urgent care - within or outside the va, community - something closer to me within 20 miles.  VA benefits - to see what's covered or not covered, I could search, want me to do anything with that?

**Moderator: Sure.

**Participant:** Oh you get the regional office, because I have the satellite office near me I never have to use that.

**Moderator: As far as the map goes on the right - I see it shows that one icon.  Is there anything else you'd want to see on the map? What would be helpful?

**Participant:** I guess the closest is 13 miles, there's no way.. oh I guess that's building 10.  I guess it'd be nice to have numbers to make it easier.  And it's confusing - it says Satellite office.  It might want to say VAMC onsite or on campus. 

**Moderator: So compared to VA health, if you were looking at this benefits dropdown how many results would you want to see?

**Participant:** Actually I'd want it to be the same as NYC, theres much more here, see? Even if you look up the medical center, there's much much more. See florida is limited, there's much more in new york.

**Moderator: Which way would you want to see it?

**Participant:** I like New York better, New York has a lot more services than Florida.  They have a lot more hospitals in New York than in Florida. 

**Moderator: So you're splitting between ny and fl? Does your Father come with you?

**Participant:** yes, yes.

**Moderator: I have a couple general questions- when you're in New York. How many miles out would you want to see these results?

**Participant:** You know what, I'd like to see community. I think you'd see much more community in New York.  See? that's what's great - I can go under 2 miles to find urgent care in NYC.Tto me this is amazing, I don't have to drive to the main VA that's 10 miles away.  I like New York better. 

**Moderator:  When you're in Florida?

**Participant:** When I'm in florida everything is so far away but I can drive a lot faster.

**Moderator: Can you type in your Florida zip code and we can look at those results too?

**Participant:** Sure if it loads. Alright. 

 **Moderator: Here, how many mile would you travel out to get urgetn care?

**Participant:** A minimum of 2.4 miles. Is this a CVS clinic? Because they wouldn't have all the equipment that could be needed.

**Moderator: Is that somehting you'd want to see tin search results?

**Participant:** I wouldn't go to somewhere that doesn't have what I need?

**Moderator: What do you think the difference is between is retail walk in and the other?

**Participant:** You can get your meds there or you have to go to the pharmacy.

**Moderator: Okay. General question, doy ou use any map tools or applciations?

**Participant:** Google.  Alot. for maps and inforamtion, anything I need.

**Moderator: What do you likeabout Google?

**Participant:** it's fast, and usually when I get directions it's really accurate with turn by turn on my phone and if there's an accident or traffic it'll let me know

**Moderator: You're at a computer right now, is that what you'd usually use?

**Participant:** No, I'd use my phone.

**Moderator: Do you have any other question for me?

**Participant:** No, can I help you with anything?

**Moderator: You've been so helpful, actually I have one more thing if you don't mind. Can you click on va benefits one more time.  Can you talk to me a little about these options shown?

**Participant:** I'd love to see the caregiver website right there under benefits.  I have so many extra steps to get to the caregiver website.  I wouldn't use this site - I'd use google for disability claims.  

**Moderator:What would you use this tool for? I know you mentioned for travel, any other reason?

**Participant:** I look up providers to see information on the va website, you have to go to the main website to get there. If you could look up specific doctors that'd be helpful because I like to know their training ahead of time. This is all a little overwhelming.  Google is fast.  Also healthevet is not as overwhelming. I'd love to see a link.  Theres too many dropdowns.  

**Moderator: Any other feedback?

**Participant:** I was wondering if it's in any other languages besides english?

**Moderator: I'll look into that.

**Participant:** Is there any mobile app launch pad? I'm on it a lot so.  More caregive friendly information on here.

**Moderator: What kind of information?

**Participant:** Instead of 'benefits' you could have 'caregiver'.  And then if there's something we want rescources for caregivers it'd be very beneficial. Always a different perspective from the caregiver, right?

**Moderator: Definitely. I don't have any other questions, do you have any last questions?

**Participant:** Oh, can I get directions from here... oh you can. I was just wondering.  I would like for it to send a text to my phone with directions. Anything else? I don't know what people like, so the easier for me the better it is. 


## Closing

**Moderator: Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Thank you! Enjoy the rest of your day!**
