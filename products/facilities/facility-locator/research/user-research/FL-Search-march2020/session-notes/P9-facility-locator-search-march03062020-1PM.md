## Introduction

**Moderator: Thanks for joining us today! My name is Nick and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding locations on the VA website. Before we start, a few things I want to mention:**

- This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

**Participant:** *agreed will all above*

## Warm up questions

**Moderator: Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions. Tell me about your service history.**

**Participant:** Served 5 years in the army as a combat medic, stationed at ft Stuart and Campbell.  I'm a gold star wife as well, but as since re-married, seeing as how, well, no, I haven't changed my last name yet with the VA. I'm a store manager [in my city], part time, 30 hours a week and am going back to school to get a degree in psychology.

**Moderator: How often do you visit the VA website?**

**Participant:** I'm on there at least 1 a month. *[notetaker missed, listed various benefits she is checking, GI bill was one]*, making appts, reordering medication, sometimes will go on there and see if there are any kinds of courses or classes for PTSD or stuff, I navigate through it from time to time, both eBenefits, myhealthEvet and va.gov

**Moderator: Have you ever used the facility locator on the VA website?**

**Participant:** I did

**Moderator: Tell me about a time you used the facility locator? What did you use it for?**

**Participant:** When I first moved up here to [my city] I was trying to see where I could go. [lists various locations in the area]. I liked that there was a women's center because some of my PTSD claim is from MST (or MSD?) and you don't want a Male doctor dealing with your female issues.

## Task 1 - Find Facility Locator

**Moderator: I'm going to send you a link to the VA website. Once you have it pulled up, will you share you screen with me? I will be asking you to complete a few tasks. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions.**

**Participant:** *went to myhealthEvet* "that's how I normally sign into it"

*Difficulties screen sharing*

**Moderator: You've come to the VA website because you need help applying for a VA Home Loan and want to talk to someone at a VA facility. Show us how you would do that.**

**Participant:** *scrolls toward bottom of page* I'm going to look for something that I would associate, with, you're talking about a VA hospital or a VA clinic?

*moderator repeats home loan*

*participant scrolls back up to housing assistance*

**Participant:** I'd go to housing assistance, *clicks link* I'd look on this page, and I could message them online right there, *mouses over right sidebar*... that looks like about it. Or if I wanted to call them, I could.

*moderator emphasizes facility and asks to show how else she'd do it* 

*Participant reads content on page* "Find a regional home loan center" *clicks, and lands on benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/* I would email these people and ask to set something up or I would call this number right here.

*moderator guides user to Find a VA Location in the navigation, asks user to use facility locator*

*Participant searches zip code, selects benefits from facility type, and then home loan from service type. Has no trouble at all finding this.*

**Participant**: And those are the two centers it brought up.

.

## Task 2 - Review results

**Moderator: I noticed when you were searching you chose benefits, why?**

**Participant**: Because the home loan is one of the benefits that we have being veterans, of course it wouldn't be a cemetery, providers or pharmacy, urgent care of health, naturally I aligned it with benefits.

**Moderator: When you chose your service type, why?**

It was pretty clear and concise saying home loan help

**Moderator: What are your impressions of the search results?**

**Participant:** They're very limited. Like 200-300 miles away.

**Moderator: How many search results would you expect to see?**

**Participant:** Probably at least more than 2, especially major cities [in the TN state] alone

**Moderator: If you chose one, how would you choose one?**

**Participant:** Probably proximity

## Task 3 - Start new search

**Moderator: Great! I'm going to give you another scenario: You have a sore throat and want to find a community clinic that provides urgent care for Veterans close to your house. Show us what you would do to find this.**

**Participant:** I would go to urgent care, and urgent care providers, because it makes the most sense to me. I found out about this 2 weeks ago from another Veteran, that we could actually go to urgent care facilities if traveling to our VA was too much [audio cut out]. I didn't know that was a thing.

**Moderator: Prior to that conversation with the other veteran, what would you have done in this scenario?**

**Participant**: I would've called my primary care manager and got the first available appt. If it was something like strep throat...I'd just hope they would have something open. Normally, they can find a spot at the women's clinic but I have to wait a day or two. Honestly I was never told about this by the VA. I was told by another Vet who told me there was one nearby and I just have to show them my VA id and they help you with everything including your medication.

**Moderator: If you were traveling to visit a friend in a city, and wanted to look up a nearby veteran hospital, show me how you would do that?**

**Participant**: I would go in this same little box. *clicks into city, state, zip field* Lets just put my mom's address in there, *attempts to enter address, goes with zip*

And I would look for VA health, and you said a hospital?

**Moderator: yes, a nearby veteran hospital**

*Selects VA health from facility, and Emergency care from service type*

*internet problems, stalls*

**Moderator: are you more comfortable with a zip code over a city?**

*Participant:* No, it's just what I thought of. I can type Culver City.

**We said a hospital - how come you chose emergency care?**

I align emergency care with an emergency room

*opens facility type dropdown and scrolls to see options*

**Moderator: and you're searching to see if that would still align? Are VA Health and VA Center interchangeable to you?**

Sometimes. Health I think is everything, right?



## Follow up

**Moderator: How many results do you want to see after you search?**

**Participant:** It depends on what I'm looking for. Some things are understandable. I would prefer, in the scenario where we were looking for the loan centers, I'd like to see something less than 200 miles away.  I mean, the 76 miles for a clinic, I'd go if I had to. I do know if that it's over 50 miles, you can go to your local ER and let them know when you're admitted that you're a veteran, you're service connected, show your ID, and they'll work with the VA to process that.

**Moderator: If you were traveling, and it was in a city you're not familiar with, and you wanted to see your nearest medical center, how would you go about that?**

**Participant:** *chooses facility type. Scrolls up and down over service type dropdown* I guess I'd have to go to emergency care, because that's where a hospital would be? *uncertain* But all of these things would be at a hospital too, wouldn't they? hmm. I guess I'd do that *selects emergency care* and then I'd look at my search results.

So, this shows me a clinic at 1.2 miles, and I'm guessing that Jesse Brown is a hospital because it's medical center. But also a hospital.

**Moderator: how would you determine if it was a hospital or not?**

**Participant**:  I'd call them. *scrolls down* That says hospital, but it says junior hospital? What's a junior hospital? hmm. Yeah I'd call them.

**Moderator: Looking at these results, how many results would you like to see in the search results, in the search result area?**

**Participant**: Seeing as how we're searching a major city, I'm very pleased with these results. Even though they span as far as 48 miles away, *[notetaker missed]* I don't know what a junior hospital is. 

**Moderator: would a search of a non-major city impact the search results?**

**Participant**: I think so. I noticed with my experience in moving around even within Tennessee, VA hospitals [missed it] you would have to travel, when I lived in Bulls Gap, I had to go to Johnson city, when I lived in Knoxville, that was convenient there were just so many options.

**Moderator: so if it was rural would you expect to see the same amount of results?**

**Participant**: No, because I know the demand for a VA hospital might not be as high as it would be in a major city, so you know, I'm understanding of the distance as far as a hospital goes.

**Moderator: What would be the most important top 3 things you'd look at in the search results, rural vs urban?**

**Participant**: Regardless of proximity, if I have a problem, I have to go somewhere. My priorities are the closest [location] that meets my needs, because I have to get the problem fixed.

**Moderator: Do you use any sort of map applications? If so, which one(s)?**

**Participant:** Google maps on my phone

**Moderator: What kind of device do you normally use?**

**Participant:** it's an android

**Moderator: Would you use that device to search for facilities on VA.gov?**

**Participant:** yeah

**Moderator: Any questions for me?** 

**Participant:** No sir.

## Closing

**Moderator: Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson?**

**Participant:** Notes here

**Moderator: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. Enjoy the rest of your day!**
