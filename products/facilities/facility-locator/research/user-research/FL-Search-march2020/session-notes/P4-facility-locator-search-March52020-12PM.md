## Introduction

**Moderator: Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding locations on the VA website. Before we start, a few things I want to mention:**

- This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

**Participant:** works in an open office space

## Warm up questions

**Moderator: Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions. Tell me about your service history.**

**Participant:** I was active duty from 2008-2015 and then in the reserve since then

**Moderator: How often do you visit the VA website?**

**Participant:** Which VA website? (va.gov) It depends. I go on eBenefits fairly frequently to pull info for various things and I go on my healthEvet less frequently, really only when I need to schedule an appointment or do something at the VA hospital. 

Most recently I had to switch VA hospitals which has been a frustrating process but I visited most recently because I had to schedule an intake appt at the NY facility which is where I'm at now.

**Moderator: Have you ever used the facility locator on the VA website?**

**Participant:** Yes

**Moderator: Tell me about a time you used the facility locator? What did you use it for?**

**Participant:** Ive used it in both Boston and NY when I first sought to find VA facilities. So the first time I used it, I'm trying to remember if the first location I got from that, or if it was something different, and then I used it to find the right one. 

The first VA facility I went to in Boston was not a hospital, and I was trying to get to a hospital so there was some confusion there. it was 4-5 years ago and I don't know if the first time I used the locator or not. Most recently, having learned from that experience, I used the locator to find my VA hospital for Manhattan where I went for my intake appt.

## Task 1 - Find Facility Locator

**Moderator: I'm going to send you a link to the VA website. Once you have it pulled up, will you share you screen with me? I will be asking you to complete a few tasks. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions.**

*moderator and participant work through sharing screen difficulties*

**Participant:** *using a mobile device! Appears to be an iPhone* 

**Moderator: - You've come to the VA website because you need help applying for benefits and want to see someone in person at a VA facility. Show us how you would do that.**

**Participant:** Just from the coronavirus announcement, I see a link to the VA medical center, I'd click there because it gives me the impression I'd get a list there. Otherwise I'd scroll down and see if there was an easy link, and...here we go (*toward bottom of page)*, find a VA facility. 

If this button wasn't there, I'd probably look at the menu, and if it wasn't there, I'd go to the search menu up at the top.  *clicks link*

*scrolls page, enters search field*. *Notetaker missed visually what happened next.*

**Moderator: Can you tell me what you might be looking for when you're looking at these results?**

**Participant:** first lesson I learned is that not all VA facilities are created equal, which I learned years ago. Now that I know that, I'd have a keen eye toward picking the thing that I thought was related to what I needed.  ... I see here for example that there are clinics, I wouldn't trust that going to clinic would get me what I needed because of my previous experiences, so I'd always go for the central medical center where I feel like the odds are the highest that they'll have what I'm going for

## Task 2 - Review results

**Moderator: I noticed you clicked [search info]. Talk about why you chose this.**

*notetaker did not hear this question asked*

**Moderator: What are your impressions of the search results?**

*notetaker did not hear this question asked in this way*

**Moderator: How many search results would you expect to see?**

**Participant:** I'd expect to see 3-4 on average. But I think it depends on the size of the metro area I was in at the time. For example Boston, my last place of residence, is a relatively small city. Obviously NY is a much large metro area, so I'm not surprised to see all of these. But in my case, since I live in Manhattan, I'd be focused on the 2 facilities there.

**Moderator: I noticed you left the facility type and service selected and then hit search**

*Notetaker missed exact prompt*

**Participant** The prompt you gave was for a health appointment ... I would expect it has to be a health facility.  As I said the lesson that I learned before [told me that not all facilities have health appointments]. But since you told me I was going to a doctors appointment the health looked like it was the right option.

**Moderator: Why would you choose [the one they choose]?**

*notetaker did not hear this question asked in this way*

**Benefits prompt**

***ALERT: notetaker miss! ~15min time stamp, review video.***  

I'd click on here to see what was in here... I'd be confused by VA health and VA benefits. I would think benefits means something other than health, specifically.  



## Task 3 - Start new search

**Moderator: Great! I'm going to give you another scenario: You woke up and you're pretty sure you have the flu, and want to go to clinic that provides urgent care for Veterans close to your house. Show us what you would do to find this.**

**Participant:** I would just click urgent care *(second menu input)*, and then search.

**Moderator: Can you talk to me about these listings and how far you'd be willing to go to get urgent care?**

I wouldn't go further than the Manhattan VA medical center.  Honestly, even that is probably a stretch.  I'd only go there because it's in Manhattan and I can get there easily. 

It's not so much a matter of distance as much as being easy to get there.  Honestly, if it's accessible via public transit in a reasonable time Frame, 45 min-ish or a cheap, cost effective cab ride.

**Moderator: How many results would you expect to see here for urgent care?**

Probably not that many. I didn't really even think the VA did urgent care stuff. I would've just assumed to seek a medical center as the only option.  Which is what I see here.

**Moderator: Scroll back to the drop downs. Under urgent care I noticed you didn't select the service type. Why?**

I saw that it automatically switched.

I don't have a sense of trust with the VA and going somewhere else, and having it be seamless and easy to do. I'd of course be attracted to the idea of going to something closer than the medical center, but I'd be worried that there'd be an issue with getting the VA to pay for it, so I would default to going to the medical center to be sure there wouldn't be any problems.

**Moderator: Select benefits dropdown. I know you mentioned health being it's own kind of benefit vs others. If you selected that what would you expect to see?  **Would expect less search results, like 1-2, because these types of benefits can be done out of a smaller office that's more centralized, it doesn't require a large footprint, and I would think there's less demand for those than the basic healthcare stuff.  

**Moderator: How many miles out is too far or the furthest you'd be willing to go, from your current location?**

I wouldn't go off the island of Manhattan if I could avoid it. Max of maybe 2-3 miles north south, and maybe 1 mile east west.

**Moderator: Click on map tab. Would you ever use the map in any instance using the locator?**

Yes

**Moderator: how many** {missed exact question}

Expectations? I don't know. Honestly I have no idea. Whenever you use a map function on any website, you get a range of initial  settings as far as scope. Some zoom in on a location right away and others are very broad and you have to zoom in.  I don't have an expectation.

 I'm surprised when I did this one that its focused on Manhattan and it's showing me Manhattan. 

**Moderator: why are you surprised?** 

Surprised because it's exactly what I'd want to see, and I don't have to zoom in or out.

This is exactly what I prefer. But if not this, I prefer it shows me my location *and* my nearest location. [in the same view] so at the very least, I can see how close the nearest location is.

## Follow up

**Moderator: How many results do you want to see after you search?**

*notetaker did not hear this question asked in this way, I think it's answered above*

**Moderator: Do you use any sort of map applications? If so, which one(s)?**

**Participant:** Google maps

**Moderator: What kind of device do you normally use?**

**Participant:** an iPhone

**Moderator: Would you use that device to search for facilities on VA.gov?**

**Participant:** iPhone

**Click on benefit services dropdown**. **Impressions on options**

There's more than I thought, but none of them surprise me. They're some of the ancillary benefits I mentioned earlier. There's more here than I knew about. I do find it helpful.

**Moderator: Any questions for me?**

**Participant:** No

## Closing

**Moderator: Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson?**

**Participant:** Yeah, probably!

**Moderator: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. Enjoy the rest of your day!**
