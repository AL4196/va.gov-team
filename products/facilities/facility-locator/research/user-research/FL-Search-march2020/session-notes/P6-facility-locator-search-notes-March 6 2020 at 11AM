## Introduction

**Moderator: Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding locations on the VA website. Before we start, a few things I want to mention:**

- This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

**Participant:** Yes I'm fine with that.

## Warm up questions

**Moderator: Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions. Tell me about your service history.**

**Participant:** Umm, I enlisted in nov of 1988, I joined int he us marine care. Honorable discharge in 1991 in the grade of corporal.  Desert storm, desert shield.

**Moderator: How often do you visit the VA website?**

**Participant:** Umm quite often, that's because of my appt on there with the doctors. 

**Moderator: Have you ever used the facility locator on the VA website?**

**Participant:** Is there something supposed to be coming up on my screen?

No not yet

Can you repeat?

I've used it once.

Can you tell me about that time

I was using the computer to get VA appt, and I just pressed in pittsburgh VA.  And it sent me out, I don't know why, and it sent me tot he location out in south chapel or aspen wall.  Amnd I knew there was one closer than that because that one is far out.  The on that's on ... pennsylvania.  

How did you find that first one?

Like I said this is acoupel years ago, I type din va facilities near me.  It seems like that would've been the one to meet my needs and it wasnt.

## Task 1 - Find Facility Locator

**Moderator: I'm going to send you a link to the VA website. Once you have it pulled up, will you share you screen with me? I will be asking you to complete a few tasks. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions.**

**Participant:** Can you see my screen?

Yep.

Hi

Haha Hello.

**Moderator: You've come to the VA website because you need help applying for a VA Home Loan and want to talk to someone at a VA facility. Show us how you would do that.**

**Participant:** Yeah, good luck with that.

Can you show me how you'd find that information.

Yeah - I had to go through it and it was a pain int hea ss. Not to say that the website was, but to try to get someone to get you back with information. first I would look under housing assistance.  Find out if youre eligivle for a va backed home loan.  I'd click on that. So I'm reading this top part - we also offer benefits to service to improve and keep your current home. This sound sliek something I ewould need.  On this page you wopud you get va home benefits, get va housing assistance grants.  So you're saying how would I apply?

Let's say you've already applied, and you want to see someone in person to talk about it.

I'm scrolling down tot he bottom, I'm looking. Okay, message us with a question online.  ebenefits, technical support. No. So I want to talk to somebody in person...I think from there I would uhhh... go to va benefits.

So if you could scroll up to the top - let's say that you specifically want to look for a location that can explain your benefits.  Can you show me how you'd do that?

Id' go to va benefits and healthcare which is listed at the top, then my benefits... well here's my healtchare one, that one came up right away. Get healtcahre benefits... WErvice memeber benefits, that's what I would press.  VA benefits for services members.  Benefits that y you can use during and after your service... ummm I think I'd probably use that button. I'm gonna click ont hat one.  Oh wait a minute, I see down here it says benefits you can use before and after service... it says GI benefits. Certificates for va backed home loans.  Life insurance.  So. it depends on what benefit I'm looking for.  Am I looking for education, or housing, or some kind of insurance or medical.  

Okay. I"l havee you scroll to the top one more time. Can you click on facility locator. Let's say you have a questiona bout home loan benefits, show me what you would od on this page to get your questions answered in person.

Okay. I"m seeing here ... how many miles away I am from something.  I'm seeing urhgetn care... I'm going to clickva benefitis.  Chose a service type.  Burials.... I"m loking for va home loan help.  I cleicked that.  Serach part up top I put my address. Press a search... And Oh My.  Why did it show that?  It showed for me just now with my street address typed into the top part, choose a va facaility, va benefits.  The next is choose a service type. The resulets gave me 118 miles to cleveleand benefits office.  

What are your imnpressions of that?

You mean I'd have to go out of state to personally talk to somebody?  Or ot get some help? I'd have to call them in cleveland ohio.

Okay.  If you actually did have a question, how would you go about finding information for a benefit or a loan or something like that?

OKay, I"m going abck tothe home bar. Okay. Udnernateh that I'm going to see... you mean if I need to talk to someone face to face? Or call someone?

What would you do if you had a question.

Oh I;'d do this contact us... oh my why ithat number up there like that.  I'd proably go back to find my va location and see if somebody was close.  Amd then from there.  Now it cam e up 4.6 mioles... va center. Which is the one I gho to now. From there I'd call the main number, buecaseu I just need a little help. And try to get further information form there. 

**Moderator: Great! I'm going to give you another scenario: You have a sore throat and want to find a community clinic that provides urgent care for Veterans close to your house. Show us what you would do to find this.**

**Participant:** Through the VA?

Yes.

It says right underneith that, it says need same day for minor injuries? So, I'd just be on that same page - I'd press the va approved urgent locations. And it's saying before you seek care read this - im[ortant notice.  Click here, now it's telling me to check my eligbiligty. Annnnd the list of services, that's another website. Um. And it says underneath on the bottom, Go back out and read that bottom blue one, read this one, they are not the saem.  Then I'd press network urgent care location.

Okay, I'm going to have you go back to the find locations tab... the fourth tab up there. Yeah that one. I want to talk to you bout these search results that show up.  YO uchose your locationa dnyoure looking through your VAMC.  Can we scroll down, it says 13 results, how many would you liketo see?

3.

Why three?

Because any more than that is oging to be further than that you want to drive.  The furthest I'd want to go is probably... Actually I'd say 4.  Within a 15-20 miles limit.  I don't want to drive 37 miles, I'm not driving 37 miles to see my mother - let a lone a va appointment.  Yeah I'd say 1, 2, 3, 4... 20 miles is the limit I would drive.

If you could, go back up to the va dropdown.  It's the choose facility type with grey...search by city where you put your address in. Choose facility type, could you click ont hat?

Okay,

And then could you click on the community providers in VA network?

Okay, got it.

Oh sorry, I meant urgent care. sorry about that.

It's okay.

Could you hit search?

What is under service type?

What do you think is under ther?

That would be approriate,... va urgent care. That would be the nearest one, the one I go to.  If you need urgent car eou need something that's close to you.

Okay, so let's say the wait time is really long and you want to find a communit clinic.  Can you show me how you would find that on here?

Umm.. I'm looking under community proviers int he va network, clicke on that. Service type required... I would say um. urghent care. 

Okay.

So a clinic. And then I[m going to press search.  Oh it says please fill this field out... I just pressed ur.. and osehting else came up.  Like all these specific things, so I'm going to scroll way down where I see clinics. Clinci/center, slect that one.  Then I click search. It says please wait... well you can probably see the screen hahah. Uh. 1.9 miles. Um from where I live. 

And what are your impressions of these results?

I didn't know that that they were in network at the va, they're actually closer than where I usually go.  Oh there's a coupel pages of this.  Does this mean they are totally involved in the va or is it just urgent cares? It doesn't say... yeah it does say it... next to them it says in the va network.  So that's good.

How mny resultse would you expect to see?

I expected maybed one pgae full, just a couple, just a handful.

Some of these that are int he urgent care are like 20 something miles away.

You meantioned your va was not very far.

how fare woul dyou go for urgent care?

No more than 10.  Because if you can hold up that long for it to be that far, then it's not really urgent.  At least not u nderneath my criteria.

I see.  Okay, let's look at the map on your right.  I noticed taht you haven't interacted with the map very much?

Both of them actually, because then you can see how far away you are from your house.  I see all these medical symbols coming, I'm gonna say oh if I live right about here, I"m going to press this one it'll take me there.  This one says... why did it change?  Did you chang that?

No, I haven't done anything..

Okay... yeah it switched it.  Yeah okay. it just switched to another one.  Now it's saying there's one 4 mils away, I don't know where that's at.  Now it got me closer. I'm on page 2. Hmm. Alright so. mm. Okay, I went to page 3, sorry we couldn't complete your request. Or if you need care right away blah blah blah.  Find a location ear you.  I"m just gonng go back up and press the serach button again.  It's telling me to please wait. Hmm.  You see I'm still waiting on this?

Mmmhmm.. okay. It looks like you foudn our bug so let me give ou obne more prompt.  Could you selevt va benefits?

I noticed you were looking for something that said that. could you click on the services again and talk me through your impresssions shown here.

Well. The options are real specific, that's fine that's what you expect.  I"m looking up and down the list and scrolling, and you know my wife just died and she was a veteran.  Oh, claim health or burial. So I'm going to click ont hat - that's a serach engine. Uh oh.  Yeah it's not lettin me do it. 

You can try to refresh your page. 

Alright that did help. And it put me on cleveland again haha.

Okay I've got one more scenario for your - lets say you are traveling to visit a friend in las vegas.  You want to visit the local vamc there. Just to make sure ifanything happens or if you get injured you know hwere to go.  Can you show me how you'd do that here?

Yeah I'm traveling, I'm out my area. Okay. I'd go to. I'm going to erase my address out of my searach bar. Let's say I'm in porland oregon the city.  Put in portland. State. Oregon.  I don't know the zipcode because I'm stayin there for a bit.  Facility type. I'm ging to go to hmmmmm. let's see... Alright maybe I'll go to a vets center? No, I'd go into va helth. All va health serv ices in check a service type.  Press the search bar.  There's one a mile away in portland oregon.  I'm going to scroll down and see... community resource center don't want that.  Veterans hospital.  click on that one.  It has a main number, a website and directions.  It also has hours of operations and dates . It shows you a little map of where it's located, which is helpful.

Okay, If you could go back one page.  I noticed you scrolled over the one that was closer.  Could you talk me through what you were looking for?

I was seeing what type of services they had, if I had just pickec this one.. it's a community something or a referrall scenter, or well you need some kind of service oather than medical health.  here's a loan application you can fill out.  Oh, I didn't want that type of clinic.  That's why I went to the medical center, the other one was clinic and the other wasd a hospital.

How many search results here since you're traveling?

About 4. 

Why 4?

Because there's another thing too.  If i'm not familiar with the area, I don't want to go 20-30 miles away. And get stuck like I don't know how to get back.  LIke a problem getting back.

## Follow up

**Moderator: So I have a couple more questions I'd like toa sk you. If you were at home and we were looking at your local va hospital.. How many miles out would you like to see in those search results.

Yeah 15-20. Thats about it.

And if you traveling?

Same thing. 15 at the most with traveling.

And then can you go back to the find a location page that you were just on.  I'm going to use that as a visual. So if you look at the map here, it shows the whole area of pittsburgh.  How would you like to see that map?  

I'd rather it was more narrowed in?

Why's that?

Because when I type in my address, I don't care about something way out in Butler, I'm not going that far.  Or in east liverpool.  Generally Ic are about 1,2,3,4.  The 4 closeset to me.

Got it.

**Moderator: Do you use any sort of map applications? If so, which one(s)?**

**Participant:** Very rarely.  If I know my location then I know where things are.  Unless it's something out of the ordinary, like they want me to go in for a test.  This one... was 9 miles and I had to use the gps and I had to click in for the directions. It showed met his and it helped a little bit, but the facility is huge and it's like a maze . So I right clicked, printed it and took that with me.  

Okay, what about outside of map applications?'

My car.  I use my car gps.

Whad do you like or dislike about it?

Everything changes, even people do.  LIke I got my care in 2010, so somethings it says that are there aren't ehre anymore.  The roads have changed, so you have to get an updated dixc to download.  Which costs like 300-400 which I don't have that spare money to throw awawy right now. Other than that, I think wha your company has developed for this is amazing, it's quite accurate.

I wish I could take credit, it's all google.

**Moderator: What kind of device do you normally use?**

**Participant:** Alot of times I use my phone.

Would you use your phone to look up the va location finder?

Yes.

Any questions for me?

Is there something else that you're holding back on me?

I don't think so...

Let her rip, you only have me for a short time.

You know, I can't think of anything.

I caught you off guard. So tell me what makes you the best person for this job. I'm just kidding.

Thank you for your time and making this fun.  

**Participant:** Okay great!

**Moderator: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. Enjoy the rest of your day!**
