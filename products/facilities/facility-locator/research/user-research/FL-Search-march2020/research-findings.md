## Research Goals 

The goal of this research was to understand users expectations for search results, including the following:

- how many results they expect to be returned for a healthcare related search
- how search results are impacted by geographic setting (urban/rural)
- what geographic area they would expect the map to show by default
- how they would expect to interact with the map to change their search results
- how facility type impacts expectations

## Research Methodology 

A task-based remote, moderated usability study was conducted via Zoom between March 4 - March 6, 2020. A moderator began with introduction questions and prompted users with questions (from the conversation guide). Participants were encouraged to talk through their exploration of the Facility Locator on VA.gov. Remote observers and note takers were also in attendance.

### Who we talked to

- 4 Veterans 
- 1 Caregiver
- Geographically diverse (IN, NY, FL, PA, TN)
  - 3 rural
  - 2 urban
- Ages varied 25-64 years of age (exact data unknown)

### Research Questions

- How does user interaction with the map and search results differ between urban and rural residents?
- What impact does facility or service type have on how participants interact with search results?
- How many search results should the facility locator display before pagination?
- How do participants utilize the map and search results together?
- How do particpants expect to refine their search results?

## Key Findings

1. The expected number of search results varies based on geographic location.
2. The most likely use-case for the Facility Locator is when a person is traveling or researching an unfamiliar area.
3. Participants did not refer to the Facility Locator when seeking help for a specific issue.
4. The map is a secondary source for users to find a location.
5. Participants are more likely to look for VA Medical Centers than non-VA locations.

## Details of Findings

**1. The expected number of search results varies based on geographic location.** Overall, participants did not want to see more than 5 results per page. Rural participants wanted to see 2-3 results returned and mentioned that anything listed after that would be too far to travel. Urban participants expected to see a larger _total_ number of results returned, but mentioned that they would generally want to see around 5 locations listed. 

**2. Veterans and caregivers are most likely to use the Facility Locator when traveling or researching unfamiliar areas.** Each participant we spoke with mentioned that they had previously used the locator when they didn't know what services would be available to them in a new area. Most commonly, participants said they used it when preparing for a move to a new location. 

**3. Participants did not refer to the Facility Locator when seeking help for a specific issue.** When prompted to seek in-person help for a home loan, all participants looked in the VA Benefits and Health Care dropdown or the white boxes on the VA.gov homepage. Most participants wanted find a message center or a phone number to call before attempting to visit a location.

**4. The map is a secondary source for users to find a location.** All participants viewed the list of search results; observing the distanced, name of location, and address. We observed that they used the map to compare pins of locations. A few participants wanted to see an indicator of their current location on the map. Geographically, urban participants were more satisifed with the results listed on the map as the radius shown was smaller (15 mi. or less) than what rural participants were shown (varied, generally 15+ mi.)

**5. Participants are more likely to look for VA Medical Centers than non-VA locations.** Most participants expressed a general lack of trust when it comes to VA-adjacent locations and would often scroll past clinics and non-VA locations to find VAMCs or similar locations. If a participant had experience with the Mission Act and/or community care, they trusted non-VA locations more than those who had not heard of the Mission Act.


## Additional Insights

- Benefits help offices are often far away from a user's location.
- There is a need for Caregiver specific information
- Distance and travel time vary by location
- Users interpret facility descriptions differently
- Participants depend on the name of a facility to inform their search.
- Participants want to know what services are available at a facility.

## Recommendations
- Add “search this area” functionality to map
- Show 5 results on first page
- If user moves map, require them to re-search
- Add filter for “within x miles”
- Brainstorm new card labels
- Include a "you are here" (similar to google maps) on map
- Update labels to distinguish VAMCs
- Include information on regional offices for benefits help

## Next Steps

### Update search experience
- Implement design recommendations 

### Look into Veteran journeys
- Get a better understanding of how/when Veterans interact with and visit certain facilities and how they fit into the over Veteran Health Journey

### Prepare for accessibility testing
- Meet with Jennifer S. to plan
