## Research Goals 

The goal of this research was to understand users expectations for search results, including the following:

- how many results they expect to be returned for a healthcare related search
- how search results are impacted by geographic setting (urban/rural)
- what geographic area they would expect the map to show by default
- how they would expect to interact with the map to change their search results
- how facility type impacts expectations

## Research Methodology 

A task-based remote, moderated usability study was conducted via Zoom between March 4 - March 6, 2020. A moderator began with introduction questions and prompted users with questions (from the conversation guide). Participants were encouraged to talk through their exploration of the Facility Locator on VA.gov. Remote observers and note takers were also in attendance.

### Who we talked to

- 4 Veterans 
- 1 Caregiver
- Geographically diverse (IN, NY, FL, PA, TN)
  - 3 rural
  - 2 urban
- Ages varied 25-64 years of age (exact data unknown)

### Research Questions

- How does user interaction with the map and search results differ between urban and rural residents?
- What impact does facility or service type have on how participants interact with search results?
- How many search results should the facility locator display before pagination?
- How do participants utilize the map and search results together?
- How do particpants expect to refine their search results?

## Key Findings

1. The expected number of search results varies based on geographic location.
2. The most likely use-case for the Facility Locator is when a person is traveling or researching an unfamiliar area.
3. Participants did not refer to the Facility Locator when seeking help for a specific issue.
4. The map is a secondary source for users to find a location.
5. Participants are more likely to look for VA Medical Centers than non-VA locations.
6. Participants depend on the name of a facility to inform their search.
7. Participants want to know what services are available at a facility.

## Additional Insights

- Benefits help offices are often far away from a user's location.
- There is a need for Caregiver specific information
- Distance and travel time vary by location
- Users interpret facility descriptions differently

## Recommendations
- Add “search this area” functionality to map
- Show 5 results on first page
- If user moves map, require them to re-search
- Add filter for “within x miles”
- Brainstorm new card labels
- Include a "you are here" (similar to google maps) on map
- Update labels to distinguish VAMCs
- Include information on regional offices for benefits help
