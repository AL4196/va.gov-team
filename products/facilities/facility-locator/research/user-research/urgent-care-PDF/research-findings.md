## Research Goals 

The objective of this study is to gain insight on how Veterans receive content from the Urgent Care PDF. We will learn if and how Veterans understand the PDF so that we may provide feedback to the Office of Community Care. The results from this study will inform how to display an Urgent Care PDF download alert in the Facility Locator UI.

Additionally, we will learn how users understand the difference between VA Health and Non-VA Health facilities as shown in the Facility Locator UI.
