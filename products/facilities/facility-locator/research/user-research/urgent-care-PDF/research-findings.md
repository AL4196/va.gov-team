## Research Goals 

The objective of this study was to gain insight on how Veterans receive content from the Urgent Care PDF and Facility Locator so that we could provide feedback to the Office of Community Care, specifically regarding the language surrounding Community Care. Additionally, we wanted to learn how users understand the difference between VA Health and Non-VA Health (Community Care) facilities as shown in the Facility Locator UI.

## Research Methodology 

We conducted five moderated usability studies using GoToMeeting.

### Who we talked to

We conducted the study with Veterans ranging from age 35-74. 3/5 Veterans use their VA health benefits, one Veteran utilized their employer's insurance, and one Veteran utlizes TRICARE for Life.

### Research Questions

- How are Veterans interpreting the content in the PDF?
- How might we make the need for the PDF clear to Veterans through lanugage in the UI?
- Can Veterans distinguish between VA Health and Non-VA Health locations using Facility Locator?
  - Will the card labels provide enough context?
  - Are the listings in the facility type dropdown clear?
- How would Veterans present the PDF when visiting a facility (print/mobile)?
- Do Veterans know they need to bring the PDF with them to a community care facility?
