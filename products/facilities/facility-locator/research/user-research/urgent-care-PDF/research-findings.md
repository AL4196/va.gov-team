## Research Goals 

The objective of this study was to gain insight on how Veterans receive content from the Urgent Care PDF and Facility Locator so that we could provide feedback to the Office of Community Care, specifically regarding the language surrounding Community Care. Additionally, we wanted to learn how users understand the difference between VA Health and Non-VA Health (Community Care) facilities as shown in the Facility Locator UI.

## Research Methodology 

We conducted five moderated usability studies using GoToMeeting.

### Who we talked to

We conducted the study with Veterans ranging from age 35-74. 3/5 Veterans use their VA health benefits, one Veteran utilizes their employer's insurance, and one Veteran utlizes TRICARE for Life.

### Research Questions

- How are Veterans interpreting the content in the PDF?
- How might we make the need for the PDF clear to Veterans through lanugage in the UI?
- Can Veterans distinguish between VA Health and Non-VA Health locations using Facility Locator?
  - Will the card labels provide enough context?
  - Are the listings in the facility type dropdown clear?
- How would Veterans present the PDF when visiting a facility (print/mobile)?
- Do Veterans know they need to bring the PDF with them to a community care facility?
- How do Veterans currently fill prescriptions?
- Will Veterans use the facility locator to find pharmacies?

## Key Findings
1. Veterans want to know *why* they need a PDF.
2. The term "Community Care" is confusing to Veterans
3. Veterans want to view a list of available urgent care providers.
4. Veterans want to clearly and quickly understand their eligibilty for Community Care.
5. Veterans will visit pharmacies they are familiar with.
6. A PDF is a solution, but not the right solution.

## Details of Findings
**1. Veterans want to know _why_ they need a PDF.**
- Veterans did not know what to expect before downloading the PDF because the alert message does not provide an explanation of the document 
- Generally, Veterans understood that the PDF was meant to help them understand eligibility 
- _"It is not clear if it is for veterans’ facilities or no-veteran facility or contract facilities. What I see is VA."_
- _"It gives you your liabilities, that’s my impression."_
- _"It is an instructions document that clarifies the process."_
- _"You just need this paper to get the prescriptions filled or more or less an eligibility letter for the urgent care doctors."_

**2. Veterans do not know the term "Community Care."**
- Participants did not equate Community Care with Non-VA care and thought they were separate services.
- Some Veterans did not know that Community care was available under the Urgent Care location type
- _"I would start with the community care in network. If it could help me I would go there if I could not be supported I would go to urgent care"_
- _"It doesn’t show anything about non-va but they have community care. If I was looking at it is it va, non-va or urgent care."_
- _"To me it is confusing. If I am sick or in a bind I want the system to tell me which is the closest to me either va or non va."_

**3. Veterans want to view a list of available urgent care providers.**
- There was confusion around the "choose service type" dropdown after participants had chosen "Urgent care" as the location type to search by. 
- Veterans mentioned that they would want to see a list of _all_ urgent care facilities instead of having them separated.
- _"[I]...have the flu [and] can’t drive... I wouldn't care less and just want what is closest to me. So I would think for me I click then go to the facility that can see me today and is closest. "_
  
**4. Veterans want to clearly and quickly understand their eligibilty for Community Care (non-VA).**
- Participants assumed that Community Care would be a secondary option 
- Participants mentioned they would call the number provided on the PDF to get questions answered regarding their eligibility
- _"One question I have is that is says you do not have an insurance card for the benefit. Does that mean that a veteran does not need a card to get the prescription filled?"_

**5. Veterans will visit pharmacies they are familiar with.**
- Participants assumed that the urgent care facility they visit will likely have a pharmacy attached
- All participants mentioned that they would go to a pharmacy they've visted before since their information is already available.
-  _"I would do it right there in the urgent care and if it can’t be don’t I would go to CVS, Giant or Wegman’s where I have filled prescriptions before."_

**6. A PDF is a solution, but not the right solution.**
- Veterans do not actually need the document in order to receive care. Since the document serves as resource for Veterans _and_ providers, there are a few different ways the information could be presented. 
- _"Well here’s the thing if you need urgent care. You are not going to read all of this I know I wouldn’t. IF I have a migraine I won’t read this before I see a doctor. It won’t happen."_ 
- _"I would not wait until I am dying or feeling awful to navigate through 3 pages of paperwork here. I do understand nearly all of it but I would have to slowly go through and ensure that if I have questions someone would be on the other end to help me."_

## Additional Insights
- Test how Veterans would relate Community Care to their other benefits
- Multiple participants expected to get care via the Community Care dropdown instead of Urgent Care
  - What do Veterans consider urgent?

## Recommendations
- Refine language around Community Care to be more in line with natural language (non-VA) 
- Instead of a PDF, show the information as a webpage that can be referenced instead of printed out
- Provide a link to Community Care page on VA 
- Bring back quick link to Urgent Care locations
- Change button to VIEW PDF
- Show all Urgent care results together instead of classifying by type (VA or Non VA)

## Next Steps
- Align on approach for urgent care since PDF content will now be a webpage provided by OCC
- Explore "service first" based search experience
