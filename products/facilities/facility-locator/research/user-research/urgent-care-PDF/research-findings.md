## Research Goals 

The objective of this study was to gain insight on how Veterans receive content from the Urgent Care PDF and Facility Locator so that we could provide feedback to the Office of Community Care, specifically regarding the language surrounding Community Care. Additionally, we wanted to learn how users understand the difference between VA Health and Non-VA Health (Community Care) facilities as shown in the Facility Locator UI.

## Research Methodology 

We conducted five moderated usability studies using GoToMeeting.

### Who we talked to

We conducted the study with Veterans ranging from age 35-74. 3/5 Veterans use their VA health benefits, one Veteran utilizes their employer's insurance, and one Veteran utlizes TRICARE for Life.

### Research Questions

- How are Veterans interpreting the content in the PDF?
- How might we make the need for the PDF clear to Veterans through lanugage in the UI?
- Can Veterans distinguish between VA Health and Non-VA Health locations using Facility Locator?
  - Will the card labels provide enough context?
  - Are the listings in the facility type dropdown clear?
- How would Veterans present the PDF when visiting a facility (print/mobile)?
- Do Veterans know they need to bring the PDF with them to a community care facility?
- How do Veterans currently fill prescriptions?
- Will Veterans use the facility locator to find pharmacies?

## Key Findings
**1. Veterans want to know *why* they need a PDF.**

**2. The term "Community Care" is confusing to Veterans**

**3. Veterans want to view a list of available urgent care providers.**

**4. Veterans want to clearly and quickly understand their eligibilty for Community Care.**

**5. Veterans will visit pharmacies they are familiar with.**

**6. A PDF is a solution, but not the right solution.**

## Details of Findings
**1. Veterans want to know _why_ they need a PDF.**
**2. Veterans do not know the term "Community Care."**
- "To me it is confusing. If I am sick or in a bind I want the system to tell me which is the closest to me either va or non va."
**3. Veterans want to view a list of available urgent care providers.**
- There was confusion around the "choose service type" dropdown after participants had chosen "Urgent care" as the location type to search by. 
- Veterans mentioned that they would want to see a list of _all_ urgent care facilities instead of having them separated.
- _"[I]...have the flu [and] canâ€™t drive... I wouldn't care less and just want what is closest to me. So I would think for me I click then go to the facility that can see me today and is closest. "_
  
4. Veterans want to clearly and quickly understand their eligibilty for Community Care.
5. Veterans will visit pharmacies they are familiar with.
6. A PDF is a solution, but not the right solution.
  - Veterans do not actually need the document in order to receive care. Since the document serves as resource for Veterans _and_ providers, there are a few different ways the information could be presented. Participants said they would call the number provided on the PDF if they had questions about their eligibility or the services provided

## Additional Insights
- Test how Veterans would relate Community Care to their other benefits

## Recommendations
Put together initial recommendations here based on your findings. Review with your team, then edit as needed.

## Next Steps
- Document language changes
- Update urgent care (and other services) user flow
- Refine the PDF to actual visit user flow
