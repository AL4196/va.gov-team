# Conversation Guide for Facility Locator Urgent Care PDF Testing
## Introduction - 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find Urgent Care.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session**, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

**Once you are recording:** I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.

## Background - 

Tell us your name and a little about your service history. 

## Usability Test

### Scenario
Let's imagine that you need urgent care and want to visit a local facility that takes your VA benefits. For the sake of this test, you are located in Washington D.C.

**(share link)** I'm going to share a link with you. Once it loads, will you share your screen with me?

We will use a prototype to walk through a few steps in this scenario so not all links on the page will be clickable. Be sure to move a bit slower than you normally would on the web and talk me through what you are thinking.

### Task 1 
Let's imagine that you have a fever and want to find a local walk-in urgent care. What would you do on this page first?

Why did you choose [whichever location they chose]? 

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

## Post-test Questions 
I have just a few more questions to ask you before we finish up today.

## Closing - 5 min
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to offer you a $50 thank-you gift. Is it ok for us to send that gift to the same address Shannon and Brian used to communicate with you about scheduling this test? [If no] Ok, we'll follow up with an email after this session to get the right email from you in writing.

Thanks! Lastly, would you like to share this feedback opportunity with other Veterans or Veteran groups you're a part of? If so, we can send you an email with a little blurb so you can easily connect to our team.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
