# Conversation Guide for Facility Locator Urgent Care PDF Testing
## Introduction 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find Urgent Care.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session**, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

**Once you are recording:** I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.

## Background 

Tell us your name and a little about your service history. 

## Usability Test

### Scenario
Let's imagine that you have had flu-like symptoms and want to visit a local facility that takes your VA benefits. For the sake of this test, you are located in Washington D.C.

**(share link)** I'm going to share a link with you. Once it loads, will you share your screen with me?

We will use a prototype to walk through a few steps in this scenario so not all links on the page will be clickable. Be sure to move a bit slower than you normally would on the web and talk me through what you are thinking.

### Task 1 - Search
Let's imagine that you have a have flu-like symptoms and want to find a place to get care as quickly as possible. What would you do on this page first?

I noticed you chose [whichever type/location they chose]. Will you talk about why you made that choice?
[If they chose VA Health, ask them to select an option that would provide quicker care.]

Go ahead and complete your search.

### Task 2 - Download PDF
[If they do NOT notice the PDF alert, go to Task 4]

[If they notice the PDF alert] Take a moment to read that alert and let me know your thoughts on it.


### Task 3 - Read PDF
Take a moment to review the content of this PDF and provide your thoughts when you are ready.
How would you summarize this document in your own words?
What questions do you have after reading this document?

### Task 4 - Choose Pharmacy
Let's imagine that you had your visit with [whichever location they chose] and they prescribed medication. What would you do to fill that prescription?

[If they notice the PDF alert] Take a moment to read that alert and let me know your thoughts on it.

[Note: Do we need different langauge for the pharmacy alert vs urgent care facilities?]

What factors would help you determine which pharmacy to visit?


## Post-test Questions 
I have just a few more questions to ask you before we finish up today.
1. [If they did NOT notice PDF alert] I noticed you did not interact with the alert message that appeared when searching for a clinic to visit. Will you go [through task 1]  and tell me what your focus lands on? What are your thoughts on the PDF? [ask Task 3 questions]
2. Do you know what Community Care is?
3. What comes to mind when I use the term "In Network?"
4. I have a list of terms I want to ask about. Will you tell me if they make sense to you or what they may be used for?
  - VA Community Care (In Network)
  - VA Community Care Pharmacy (In Network)
  - Urgent Care vs Retail/Walk-in Care
5. How would you rate the overall clarity of the PDF?
6. How would you get additional info about your benefits? What else would be helpful to see regarding your benefits?
7. How prepared do you feel to visit a facility after using this tool?
8. What would you change about this protototype?

## Closing
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
