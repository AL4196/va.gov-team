# Research Plan for Facility Locator Urgent Care - December 2019

## Goals
This research plan is for the Facility Locator Tool on VA.gov - VSA Facility Locator team.

The Facility Locator is VA's single source of truth for customers to find VA facilities and location details about all VA facilities, across VHA, VBA, and NCA.

Our objective for this research is to learn the best way to provide location information for Urgent Care facilities on the Find VA Locations page of VA.gov.

#### Research questions:
- How can we provide access to the Benefit PDF for Veterans? 
- What details do Veterans expect to see on urgent care facilities? 
- Do Veterans understand how urgent care and community care work together? 
- Should we prioritize Urgent Care on the Find VA Locations page?

#### Hypothesis: 


## Method
Remote Moderated Usability Testing will help us gain feedback on the first iteration of the Urgent Care prototype. We will watch for pain points in the user flow and areas to improve the next iteration of the prototype.

We will be testing a prototype [Link Will Go Here] through Zoom.

## Participants and Recruitment
Participant Criteria
- Goal: 10 Participants
- Veterans and Caregivers
- All ages
- Representative gender demographic (at least 1 woman)
- All levels of familiarity with technology

Recruitment to be done through Perigean

## When? 
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours) 

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 

## Team Roles
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 
- Moderator:
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):
- Participant recruiting & screening:
- Project point of contact:
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Note-takers:
- Observers:

**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**
