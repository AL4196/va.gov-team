# Facility Locator Urgent Care Research Findings WIP
December 2019

## Methodology
We conducted moderated user testing sessions with 5 participants, one Caregiver and four Veterans, on Wendesday, December 11, 2019. The participants were recruited through the DSVA's recruitment contract with Perigean. Sessions were conducted and recorded via Zoom.

Transcripts and notes can all be found in the [Facility Locator Urgent Care Research folder.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/user-research/urgent-care)

## Summary
We tested a prototype which included a workflow for choosing an In-Network Urgent Care provider through the Facility Locator tool. We came away with a xx findings that will inform the redesign of Facility Locator to improve awareness of care provided by non-VA facilities.

#### 1. Veterans are not aware of the type of care they can receive at urgent care facilities.

- There is a general lack of communication/education around the difference between community care providers and VA health care
- There are multiple types of in-network urgent care providers that do not treat the same symptoms (e.g. retail urgent care facilities don't treat wound)
- When prompted to choose an urgent care location to stitch a wound, a majority of participants mentioned that they would visit an ER or VA facility and not an Urgent Care location. 

#### 2. Users are not likely to use the filter to find what they need.

- Participants overlooked the "quick links" provided to filter information and were drawn to location input and dropdowns.
- Participants found information that was hidden in a filter useful, but did not know it was available because they did not chose to filter their search results. 

#### 3. Overlapping benefits cause confusion when visiting in-network providers.

- Veterans could not answer directly when asked if the Urgent Care facility they visited was "in-network" or not because it could have been covered through their spouse's insurance, medicare, or another source.
- Some Veterans assumed that because they visted a clinic that was not a VA facility that it would not be covered through their VA benefits.

#### 4. Internal language and inconsistent labeling cause users to hesitate when looking into facilities.

- A majority of participants mentioned the "diagnostic" MinuteClinic was confusing and assumed it provided services that it does not.
- Participants did not understand the difference between "retail" urgent care and urgent care until they were given a definition and example treatments 

#### 5. Search results and the map
Participants wanted to see more options than were initially shown on the map for a few reasons:
- Participants visited urgent care facilities that were recommended to them but not necessarily the closest to their location
- Participants were searching for facility names that they recognize (e.g. MinuteClinic)

## Detailed Findings

**1. Find Urgent Care for a sore throat**

Overall, no participants used the quick filter links to find in-network urgent care. Though all participants found urgent care via the dropdown, initially participants overlooked the verbiage "in-VA Network Urgent Care Providers" because it is lengthy and at the bottom of the dropdown list.

- 2/5 participants selected "in-VA network urgent care providers" from the dropdown immediately
- 3/5 participants hesitated but eventually selected "in-VA network urgent care providers"

**2. Find Urgent Care to stitch a wound**

Unless prompted, participants did not distinguish between the treatments provided at retail or urgent locations. Participants assumed that stiches would be administered at a VA facility and not a community care facility.

3/5 participants followed the same path for finding urgent care to stitch a wound as they did for a sore throat
3/5 participants mentioned that they would not go to Urgent Care for stitches


**3. Interaction with search results cards**

5/5 participants would use the search result card to find more information about a location

### Post-Test Questions

**What would you say the difference is between a retail and an urgent location?**
- It’s related to their abilities. For a soar throat I could go to a retail urgent care, but if I need X-rays I would go to Urgent care. It’s a difference in services.
- When you say retail, I would think it would be inside a CVS pharmacy or something like that.
- No clue – maybe the retail urgent care…well it makes it sound like they’re going to charge me money but that doesn’t make sense, so I don’t know.
- I don’t know the difference.
- A retail urgent care center may be part of an outside location not associated with the VA. It might be like a clinic or an urgent care clinic located in a strip mall or something. I’m guessing.

**Was it intuitive to find the appropriate Urgent Care location?**
- Yes, it was pretty straight forward. It looks like a lot of other searches I’ve used before
- Yes this is very common compared to other things on the web.
- It wasn’t bad. The list tells you they take VA

**What was your favorite part of the prototype?**
- I like the map. Well I like several things, I like the ordered facilities by closest to where I am. And the matching of the letters A B C to the locations.
- I appreciated the map view. And I liked the layout, it was easy to look at.
- I like the map. Because it shows me where these places are, and I’m always concerned about how I’ll get to these places and how Ill get back.
- The map
- I honestly like the way you can see the clinics in relation to the location on the map.

**If you had a magic wand, what would you change about this prototype?**
- I would like more options to pop-up on the map so I don’t have to scroll from page to page to see my top 10 options.
- I’d like to include the hours int eh box for the facilities.
- Regarding the descriptions of the retail urgent care and urgent care: I don’t know that I would’ve thought to click on the filter to find the definition. IDK if there’s too much text to actually have it on the screen so maybe there could be a thing that says “services available.”
- I’d change the name of that facility to be more clear. It was not intuitive to find the definition of urgent and retail urgent care under the filters.
- A + or – for zooming on the map.
- One thing, I would add a link to outside transportation to arrange a ride.

## Actionable Recommendations
The following are recommendations to consider during the redesign of the Facility Locator Tool:

#### Display facility names that are familiar with users (e.g. MinuteClinic at CVS) 
  - Participants immediately recognized retail urgent care locations when they were associated with a store or name they've seen before (like CVS, Walgreens, etc.)

#### Organize/Prioritize dropdown and filter lists

## Additional Questions
- What differences exists between how Caregivers and Veterans use Facility Locator?
