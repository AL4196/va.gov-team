# Facility Locator Urgent Care Research Findings WIP
December 2019

## Methodology
We conducted moderated user testing sessions with 5 participants, one Caregiver and four Veterans, on Wendesday, December 11, 2019. The participants were recruited through the DSVA's recruitment contract with Perigean. Sessions were conducted and recorded via Zoom.

Transcripts and notes can all be found in the [Facility Locator Urgent Care Research folder.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/user-research/urgent-care)

## Summary
We tested a prototype which included a workflow for choosing an In-Network Urgent Care provider through the Facility Locator tool. We came away with a xx findings that will inform the redesign of Facility Locator to improve awareness of care provided by non-VA facilities.

#### 1. Veterans are not aware of the type of care they can receive at urgent care facilities.

- There is a general lack of communication/education around the difference between community care providers and VA health care
- There are multiple types of in-network urgent care providers that do not treat the same symptoms (e.g. retail urgent care facilities don't treat wound)
- When prompted to choose an urgent care location to stitch a wound, a majority of participants mentioned that they would visit an ER or VA facility and not an Urgent Care location. 

#### 2. Users are not likely to use the filter to find what they need.

- Participants overlooked the "quick links" provided to filter information and were drawn to location input and dropdowns.
- Participants found information that was hidden in a filter useful, but did not know it was available because they did not chose to filter their search results. 

#### 3. Overlapping benefits cause confusion when visiting in-network providers.

- Veterans could not answer directly when asked if the Urgent Care facility they visited was "in-network" or not because it could have been covered through their spouse's insurance, medicare, or another source.
- Some Veterans assumed that because they visted a clinic that was not a VA facility that it would not be covered through their VA benefits.

#### 4. Internal language and inconsistent labeling cause users to hesitate when looking into facilities.

- A majority of participants mentioned the "diagnostic" MinuteClinic was confusing and assumed it provided services that it does not.
- Participants did not understand the difference between "retail" urgent care and urgent care until they were given a definition and example treatments 

#### 5. Search results and the map
Participants wanted to see more options than were initially shown on the map for a few reasons:
- Participants visited urgent care facilities that were recommended to them but not necessarily the closest to their location
- Participants were searching for facility names that they recognize (e.g. MinuteClinic)

## Detailed Findings

#### 1. Find Urgent Care for a sore throat

Overall, no participants used the quick filter links to find in-network urgent care. Though all participants found urgent care via the dropdown, initially participants overlooked the verbiage "in-VA Network Urgent Care Providers" because it is lengthy and at the bottom of the dropdown list.

- x/5 participants selected "in-VA network urgent care providers" from the dropdown immediately
- x/5 participants hesitated but eventually selected "in-VA network urgent care providers"

#### 2. Find Urgent Care to stitch a wound

#### 3. Interaction with search results cards

#### Post-Test Questions
- What would you say the difference is between a retail and an urgent location?
- Was it intuitive to find the appropriate Urgent Care location?
- What was your favorite part of the prototype?
- What was your least favorite part?
- If you had a magic wand, what would you change about this prototype?


## Actionable Recommendations
The following are recommendations to consider during the redesign of the Facility Locator Tool:

#### Display facility names that are familiar with users (e.g. MinuteClinic at CVS) 
  - Participants immediately recognized retail urgent care locations when they were associated with a store or name they've seen before (like CVS, Walgreens, etc.)

## Additional Questions
- What differences exists between how Caregivers and Veterans use Facility Locator?
