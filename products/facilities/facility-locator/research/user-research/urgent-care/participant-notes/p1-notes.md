## Introduction

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find Urgent Care.
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session**, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

**Once you are recording:** I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.

## Background - 5 min

#### Tell us your name and a little about your service history. 
I’m a caregiver to my husband who was US Army for 12 years before he medically retired. He has been diagnosed with PTSD, brain injury, depression, and anxiety just to name the more impactful ones. He also suffers from suicidal ideations. My goal is to ensure that his mental health is as stable as it can be as an outsider can do, as well as manage his primary care and his care when it comes to his specialists as well. He can’t handle doing those things himself. Day to day he works full time and can handle himself with that, but I handle everything else. 
Have you ever visited an urgent care location?
Yes, we have.
Do you know if it was in-network or not?
It got covered by the VA, but I don’t know. We live 45 to 60 minutes south of his VA…with traffic. He was really sick (possibly mono or strep) but we didn’t want to go to the hospital because of the cost and didn’t want to make that drive to the VA. We heard about the act that makes it possible for him to go to urgent care. We looked it up on the VA website to verify. We went to the one down the street and it really made life a lot easier because it was in our neighborhood and he got treated right there. It’s the only time we’ve had to use it and it was a positive experience – one of the few positive experiences we’ve had regarding the VA. It was very helpful to go there instead of a military facility. He even felt more comfortable going. Overall, it was a positive experience. 
How did you find out about that location?
I believe we called, after a google search, the closest ones and asked if they would cover us.
**(share link)** I'm going to share a link with you. Once it loads, will you share your screen with me?

## Usability Test
I'm going to ask you a few questions about this site. While we look at the website, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Talk me through what you are doing. This is only a prototype, so not all links will be clickable.
### Scenario 1
Let's imagine you are coming to the site because you need to visit an Urgent Care location. 
### Task 1 - Find Urgent Care
Let's imagine that you are coming to the site because you need urgent care for a sore throat. From this page, tell me what you would do first in order to find urgent care. Remember to think aloud -- not everything on the page will be clickable. 
 After staring at it for a minute, I noticed the quick filters; but I may have dropped into the search by zip code at first. I would choose the “in-VA network urgent care provider” based on what I know about urgent care today for the VA. From here I’d search my zip and see if I recognize any of the names. From there I’d choose the one that seemed the most familiar to me or the one that’s closest to me because I ‘m familiar with that. 

 (Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)
[Ask to go back to the "first" page]
Now let's imagine you are coming to the site because you have a wound and probably need stiches. From this page, tell me what you would do first in order to find urgent care to stitch your wound.
I would probably not use this website. I’d probably go to the nearest military hospital. Just because I know we’ve had things like that happen before and it’s just engrained in us to drive to the military hospital, it’s never occurred to us to do it another way and calling 911 may require us to pay out of pocket. We usually default to the emergency room.

### Task 2 - Review PDF Alert
Please provide feedback on the elements as they appear on the screen. Is there anything confusing?

[If PDF alert shows] Provide feedback on this alert. Does the messaging make sense? What do you think the purpose of this alert is? What do you think could make this clearer?

Please click the area of the screen that would allow you to select a location.
(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)
### Task 3 - Select Location
Let's imagine that you are ready to select a location and want to know the phone number. What would you do on this page to find a location?

 How would you go about finding information like address and phone number?
I’d click on the blue name of the facility to get information – such as a list of services they provide, their hours of operation, if they’d cover us, and their contact information. 
## Post-test Questions 
I have just a few more questions to ask you before we finish up today.
- What would you say the difference is between a retail and an urgent location? 
When you say retail, I would think it would be inside a CVS pharmacy or something like that.
- Was it intuitive to filter the search in order to find an Urgent Care location?
Yes, it was pretty straight forward. It looks like a lot of other searches I’ve used before
- What was your favorite part of the prototype?
I appreciated the map view. And I liked the layout, it was easy to look at.
- What was your least favorite part?
I would like more options to pop-up on the map so I don’t have to scroll from page to page to see my top 10 options. As in, have it scrollable instead of having to navigate from page to page. I like to see everything before I make a choice and I don’t want to have to go to page 11 to do that. If you want the providers to be seen and used equally then only sowing the ones within a half mile radius will lead to farther ones being used less and ones that are closest to most people become overused and too busy. So, seeing more options will help people choose one that is better for their daily routine or traffic. 
- If you had a magic wand, what would you change about this prototype?

## Closing - 5 min
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to offer you a $50 thank-you gift. Is it ok for us to send that gift to the same address Shannon and Brian used to communicate with you about scheduling this test? [If no] Ok, we'll follow up with an email after this session to get the right email from you in writing.
Thanks! Lastly, would you like to share this feedback opportunity with other Veterans or Veteran groups you're a part of? If so, we can send you an email with a little blurb so you can easily connect to our team.
Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
 your day!
