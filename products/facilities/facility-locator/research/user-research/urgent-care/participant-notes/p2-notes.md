## Introduction

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find Urgent Care.
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session**, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

**Once you are recording:** I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.

## Background - 5 min

#### Tell us your name and a little about your service history. 
I was in the Army nurse corp and served on active duty for 3 years including a tour in Vietnam and stayed in duty until I retired as lieutenant colonel.

#### Have you ever visited an urgent care location?
I’ve been to urgent care, but I didn’t know the VA had them.

#### Do you know if it was in-network or not?
No

#### How did you find out about that location?
I did emergency care for 50 years so I’m knowledgeable about the facilities, but I needed to go to one (urgent care location) when I was out of town. I think I used Google probably.

**(share link)** I'm going to share a link with you. Once it loads, will you share your screen with me?

## Usability Test
I'm going to ask you a few questions about this site. While we look at the website, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Talk me through what you are doing. This is only a prototype, so not all links will be clickable.

### Scenario 1
Let's imagine you are coming to the site because you need to visit an Urgent Care location in Washington D.C.

### Task 1 - Find Urgent Care

**Moderator** Let's imagine that you are coming to the site because you need urgent care for a sore throat. From this page, tell me what you would do first in order to find urgent care. Remember to think aloud -- not everything on the page will be clickable. 

**Participant**  I’d just find the closest urgent care. I’d change the VA facility type if there weren’t any then I’d just go to the…well I don’t see what the choices are….looks like they’re all VA so I’d get out of this and go to Google and look for urgent care

I guess I’d click on “in-VA network urgent care” Part of the problem is that none of these are described as an urgent care facility. I would go under VA urgent care…the 3rd thing at the top and then I would want to go…well I would go the fourth one, I guess.

It mentioned…I’d click “MinuteClinic Diagnostic of the District” which is a confusing title it doesn’t say urgent care which is a problem.

**Moderator** Now let's imagine you are coming to the site because you have a wound and probably need stiches. From this page, tell me what you would do first in order to find urgent care to stitch your wound.

**Participant** Well same thing, you wouldn’t need to go to urgent care for that one. But I would go through the same process. 

### Task 2 - Select Location

**Moderator** Let's imagine that you are ready to select a location and want to know the phone number. What would you do on this page to find that information?

**Participant** I would use the locations name and click on it to see if I could find more. (expected to see: hours, contact info, location, and what they accept)

## Post-test Questions 
I have just a few more questions to ask you before we finish up today.

#### What would you say the difference is between a retail and an urgent location? 
It’s related to their abilities. For a soar throat I could go to a retail urgent care, but if I need X-rays I would go to Urgent care. It’s a difference in services. 

#### Was it intuitive to filter the search in order to find an Urgent Care location?
They aren’t very bright, they could be bigger. The print is very small.

#### What was your favorite part of the prototype?
I like the map. Well I like several things, I like the ordered facilities by closest to where I am. And the matching of the letters A B C to the locations. 

#### If you had a magic wand, what would you change about this prototype?
I’d make the filter print bolder. I don’t know whether it’s doable, but I’d like to include the hours int eh box for the facilities.

There’s a 3rd category besides retail urgent care and urgent care which are freestanding emergency centers. You might want to think about including that…I don’t know if there are any in D.C. but you might want to consider that as an option. Freestanding emergency center could save a life if they wanted to with x-ray capability and 

Regarding the descriptions of the retail urgent care and urgent care:
I don’t know that I would’ve thought to click on the filter to find the definition. IDK if there’s too much text to actually have it on the screen so maybe there could be a thing that says “services available.”

I was not aware that the VA had emergency care besides the emergency department so that’s something that should be communicated to be known.
