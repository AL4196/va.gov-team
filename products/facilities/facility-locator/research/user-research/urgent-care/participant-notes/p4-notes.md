## Introduction

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find Urgent Care.
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session**, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

**Once you are recording:** I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.

## Background - 5 min

#### Tell us your name and a little about your service history. 
I served in Marines for a little over 4 years and was honorably discharged from my station.

#### Have you ever visited an urgent care location?
I have.

#### Do you know if it was in-network or not?
It was outside the VA – nonVA care. Locally in my town.

#### How did you find out about that location?
I found it on my own, I just had to look for doctors that would accept the VA’s form of insurance and found that a lot of physicians wouldn’t accept it, but I was able to narrow it down to those who do. 

**(share link)** I'm going to share a link with you. Once it loads, will you share your screen with me?

## Usability Test
I'm going to ask you a few questions about this site. While we look at the website, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Talk me through what you are doing. This is only a prototype, so not all links will be clickable.

### Scenario 1
Let's imagine you are coming to the site because you need to visit an Urgent Care location in Washington D.C.

### Task 1 - Find Urgent Care

**Moderator** Let's imagine that you are coming to the site because you need urgent care for a sore throat. From this page, tell me what you would do first in order to find urgent care. Remember to think aloud -- not everything on the page will be clickable. 

**Participant** I see that I’m in the right location, so I chose the dropdown and “in-VA care network and provider” and then click search. And then from here I guess I would just figure out which one is closest to my house. Or I would zoom out and see which is closet to me. It looks self-explanatory to me - it doesn’t look hard to do this.

**Moderator** Now let's imagine you are coming to the site because you have a wound and probably need stiches. From this page, tell me what you would do first in order to find urgent care to stitch your wound.

**Participant** I’d go back to the drop-down, but I don’t know if I would even be on this site, I would just go to the hospital. But if it wasn’t serious, I would go here and find the closest one again. 
I’d probably just go to the hospital and notify the VA…but on this website I would go back to the same link as before and find out which ones is closet.
I see that there’s 11 pages so I would zoom out to see those other places past Letter D location. I’d put a + or = at the top of the map because I don’t think I’d look at the bottom or anywhere else. 

### Task 2 - Select Location

**Moderator** Let's imagine that you are ready to select a location and want to know the phone number. What would you do on this page to find that information?

**Participant** I’d click the name in blue. I would hope that it would bring me straight to their website. I’d look for hours and treatments and maybe some physician’s bios. If they had their phone number on here I’d just call them to see their physicians and hours and things but if I was just looking to get stitched up I’d just go there I wouldn’t click the link.

## Post-test Questions 
I have just a few more questions to ask you before we finish up today.

#### What would you say the difference is between a retail and an urgent location? 
I don’t know the difference. 

**When asked to click on “show all filters”** -> I understand the urgent care description, but I don’t really get the retail urgent care. The word retail makes me think of people selling me stuff, I wouldn’t think care with the word retail in it. 
Maybe if you just clicked on retail or urgent care a window that pops up that describes what they are. I’d use that because I wouldn’t know where else to go. 

I don’t know what these buttons are supposed to do (referring to retail urgent care and urgent care buttons). I guess this list includes both (retail urgent care / urgent care) but if you clicked on one it would narrow it down to just that one in the list.

#### Was it intuitive to filter the search in order to find an Urgent Care location?
It wasn’t bad. The list tells you they take VA. When I called to set one up with the VA, they just asked if I wanted a male or female doctor but they didn’t set it up right and I had to do all of this work myself to find someone who would cover me.  

#### What was your favorite part of the prototype?
The map

#### What would you change?
A + or – for zooming on the map.
