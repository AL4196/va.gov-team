## Introduction

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find Urgent Care.
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session**, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

**Once you are recording:** I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.

## Background - 5 min

#### Tell us your name and a little about your service history. 
I was in the Marine Corp was almost 20 years and moved around about a dozen times then retired in 2003 and worked for another 10 years as a defense contractor and have been retired since 2012.

#### Have you ever visited an urgent care location?
Yes, I have

#### Do you know if it was in-network or not?
It was not a VA facility. I don’t know if it was VA or Medicare, heck I don’t know if I was on Medicare at that time it… I don’t remember

#### How did you find out about that location?
My brother told me it was a place that would accept whatever I had.

**(share link)** I'm going to share a link with you. Once it loads, will you share your screen with me?

## Usability Test
I'm going to ask you a few questions about this site. While we look at the website, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Talk me through what you are doing. This is only a prototype, so not all links will be clickable.

### Scenario 1
Let's imagine you are coming to the site because you need to visit an Urgent Care location in Washington D.C.

### Task 1 - Find Urgent Care

**Moderator** Let's imagine that you are coming to the site because you need urgent care for a sore throat. From this page, tell me what you would do first in order to find urgent care. Remember to think aloud -- not everything on the page will be clickable. 

**Participant**  Well I’d look at the first line and look for something that applies to me, but it doesn’t look like anything does so I’ll use VA health care and click search.
I didn’t look all the way through and didn’t see the one at the bottom. This list lost me, and I didn’t choose it because it is all the way at the bottom and has so many words compared to the rest of the options.
I assume that it is showing me all the different things within a reasonable distance, I don’t know what “minute clinic diagnostic of the dist” means and I’d hit next but apparently we can’t. So, I assume A, B, and C are my options of places to go but I wanted to scroll down and see if there are any more options and then I would’ve clicked the first one because it was the closest. Sometimes there are better options that don’t appear on the first page though.

**Moderator** Now let's imagine you are coming to the site because you have a wound and probably need stiches. From this page, tell me what you would do first in order to find urgent care to stitch your wound.

**Participant** Well, if I’m bleeding out, I would’ve called 911 but I assume I’m not bleeding out– so I’d probably do the same thing and look through the list and see what looks like the most reasonable place to go. I’d also pick the easiest one to get to through traffic. 

### Task 2 - Select Location

**Moderator** Let's imagine that you are ready to select a location and want to know the phone number. What would you do on this page to find that information?

**Participant** The name (referring to the minute clinic) doesn’t make sense. The name minute clinic seems okay, but I would tend to go to a place that sounds like they offer services and doesn’t have a truncated name. 

I’d click the name of the location or the directions button. I’d click the name of the location and would expect to see a list of their services and their hours and what they accept. 

## Post-test Questions 
I have just a few more questions to ask you before we finish up today.

#### What would you say the difference is between a retail and an urgent location? 
No clue – maybe the retail urgent care…well it makes it sound like they’re going to charge me money but that doesn’t make sense, so I don’t know.

#### Was it intuitive to filter the search in order to find an Urgent Care location?
Yes- this is very common compared to other things on the web.

#### What was your favorite part of the prototype?
I like the map. Because it shows me where these places are, and I’m always concerned about how I’ll get to these places and how Ill get back. 

#### What was your least favorite part?
I’d change the name of that facility to be more clear.
It was not intuitive to find the definition of urgent and retail urgent care under the filters. To me, I wouldn’t expect that to give me the definitions

## Closing - 5 min
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
