## Introduction

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find Urgent Care.
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session**, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

**Once you are recording:** I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.

## Background - 5 min

#### Tell us your name and a little about your service history. 
 I served in the Navy from 1987-1992. I was a Navy foreman and I’m currently semi-retired. 

#### Have you ever visited an urgent care location?
Yes
#### Do you know if it was in-network or not?
Both in and out of VA network 

#### How did you find out about that location?

**(share link)** I'm going to share a link with you. Once it loads, will you share your screen with me?

## Usability Test
I'm going to ask you a few questions about this site. While we look at the website, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Talk me through what you are doing. This is only a prototype, so not all links will be clickable.

### Scenario 1
Let's imagine you are coming to the site because you need to visit an Urgent Care location in Washington D.C.

### Task 1 - Find Urgent Care

**Moderator** Let's imagine that you are coming to the site because you need urgent care for a sore throat. From this page, tell me what you would do first in order to find urgent care. Remember to think aloud -- not everything on the page will be clickable. 

**Participant**  I would look on the left-hand side where I see “Washington VA Medical Center” and see if one of those could help me or if they could direct me where to go.
If the VA was closed, I would click “in-VA network urgent care” and on the left hand side I would look at the ones and try the first one listed because it’s the closest to me and call them and see if they could help me. I’d choose the closest facility out of convenience, that’s where I’d want to go. 

**Moderator** Now let's imagine you are coming to the site because you have a wound and probably need stiches. From this page, tell me what you would do first in order to find urgent care to stitch your wound.

**Participant** I would look at the provider list and it looks like the “reliance health services” would be a good choice for me - because it is closest.

### Task 2 - Select Location

**Moderator** Let's imagine that you are ready to select a location and want to know the phone number. What would you do on this page to find that information?

**Participant** I’d call them with the number provided and ask about their services and if they would accept me. 

## Post-test Questions 
I have just a few more questions to ask you before we finish up today.

#### What would you say the difference is between a retail and an urgent location? 
A retail urgent care center may be part of an outside location not associated with the VA. It might be like a clinic or an urgent care clinic located in a strip mall or something. I’m guessing.
The definitions under show all filters make sense to me. It would be very helpful to break down the situation to know where to go depending on what’s wrong with you. 
It looks like it’s set-up very well. (regarding location of the definitions of retail urgent care and urgent care)

#### Was it intuitive to filter the search in order to find an Urgent Care location?

#### What was your favorite part of the prototype?
I honestly like the way you can see the clinics in relation to the location on the map. 

#### What was your least favorite part?
I don’t see anything that I don’t like on here. I don’t see anything wrong with it. It looks really good. One thing, I would add a link to outside transportation to arrange a ride.

## Closing - 5 min
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
