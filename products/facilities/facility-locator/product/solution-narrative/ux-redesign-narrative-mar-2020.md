## vx: March 2019

## Background

### TriWest Link

The Office of Community Care requested a number of changes to be made prior to the March 18, 2020 official roll out date. 

The links to search for urgent care and pharmacies using the TriWest page were in the final phase of this project. These links were present:
- in the intro text above the search boxes
- above the map, when the VA facility type searched was urgent care, community pharmacies or community providers
- in the error message that displayed when no results were found

To support Veterans in the new search workflow, text in the area above the search box was changed to include more explicit instructions for searching for urgent care and urgent care pharmacies. 

### Pharmacies

Labeling for pharmacies changed several times during this project. Because community pharmacies can be used in several scenarios, each with particular criteria, the determination was made to use "Community urgent care pharmacies (in VA's network)". 

In the week before the 3/18 roll out date, a discussion about the possibility of Veterans visiting an urgent care facility and an urgent care pharmacy in different regions led to the decision to hide "Community urgent care pharmacies (in VA's network)" from the VA facility type drop down. This decision was made to avoid providing misleading or inaccurate pharmacy information which could lead to a Veteran paying out of pocket for the prescription.  

This decision also required an additional update to the language in the intro text, removing the reference to pharmacies.
