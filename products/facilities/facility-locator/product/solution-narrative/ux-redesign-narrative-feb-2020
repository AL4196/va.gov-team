### Urgent care labels

Findings from the [User research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/user-research/urgent-care/research-findings.md) conducted in December including the following: 
- Preference for ER or VA facility for urgent care scenarios, rather than an Urgent Care location
- Confusion about benefit coverage at facilities outside the VA 
- Internal language and inconsistent labeling cause users to hesitate when looking into facilities.


Finding labels that are meaningful to Veterans _and_ acceptable to stakeholders was challenging during parts of this project. 
Labels considered included: 
Facility type = Urgent care with service type = Urgent care and Community urgent care providers (in VAâ€™s network)
Facility type = "Non-VA health"
