# Facility Locator UX Redesign Narrative

The purpose of this document is to provide a narrative of the iterations and decisions made during the UX redesign. 

## Timeline and Versions
- September/October 2019
- v1: November 2019
- v2: December 2019

## Beginning: September/October 2019

### Background
- The Facility Locator team was formed during September/October of 2019. 
- Based on known legacy issues and business need, it became clear that the recent implementation of Community care was not supporting Veterans, especially in their searches for urgent care. 
- Urgent care is a component of Community Care, which currently requires users to specify a service type as part of the search parameters. The logic for the search is not consistent with Veteran mental models for healthcare, causing frustration. 
- The search functionality and data quality concerns meant a link to TriWest's urgent care locator would persist above the search feature on the Facility Locator page.

## v1: November 2019

### Background
- The team spent two Discovery sprints understanding users and the data to inform the redesign. 
- User research conducted during these sprints made it clear that the presentation of search results in both the list and map was confusing to users. 
- The following images are from the first wireframe, which was reviewed and discussed with the team.
