### User Journey
- Veterans use the Facility Locator to find locations where they can access a variety of benefits and services. The Mission Act defined criteria under which Veterans may be eligible for additional benefits or an expanded list of locations. Regardless of eligibility, Veterans have a right to expect search functionality that returns relevant and meaningful facility information quickly. 

### User Stories / Use Cases
*What two or three core use cases do we believe should cover ~80% of users?*

As a Veteran using the Facility Locator, I need search results returned to me quickly so that I can have my need met. 
As a Veteran using the Facility Locator, I need to find the location closest to me (whether it is five or fifty miles away) so that I can visit the most convenient location. 
As a Veteran using the Facility Locator, I need to define my search area by interacting with the map so that the results returned are relevant to my location. 

 
### Project Rationale
_Why should this project be a priority?_ 
- The current implementation has significant latency, particularly for community care searches
- Search performance is impacted by current default settings which may not be aligned with user expectations. 
- User expectations may depend on location (urban vs rural) and type of facility searched. 
- The Facility Locator roadmap contains future iterations which will be shaped by our understanding of user expectations for search results and map interaction. 

**Stakeholder/Business drivers**
- The Office of Community Care has been dissatisfied with the usability and performance of the community care implementation. 
- Other business owners (NCA, VHA) have expressed their concern over latency and usability. 

**Findings from research conducted March 2019**
TBD 

### Project Scope and Scale
_What's in and what's out?_
- Setting default for number of search results
- Setting default for map parameters
- Enabling user interaction with the map to impact search parameters

### Not currently in scope
- Change to search UX

### Measuring Success
_How will we know if we are successful?_

**Objective 2: Enhance the search process (The search is intuitive, efficient and fast)** 
- KR 1b: Time for delivery of search results will improve by (TBD) by (date)

### Dependencies
_Are other features dependent on this one? What do we need from partners? What do we need outside of engineering?_

**Team/Internal dependencies**
 Competing priorities and front end resource constraints 

**Partner dependencies**
  - Availability of Mapbox functionality and features based on current contract and version
