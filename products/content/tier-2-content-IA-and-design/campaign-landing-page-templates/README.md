# Campaign landing page template MVP 1.0 - product outline

Campaign landing page template rolls up to the larger 2020 PW initiatives to build out [tier 2 content templates](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design).

## Problem statement
Many benefit-adjacent tier 2 content are not support/learning/help, product, or evergreen office (administrative) content. Some tier 2 content are more similar to marketing or engagement content.

- It may also have audiences other than Veterans (for example: local governments, Congress, VSOs, medical researchers).
- It may also be time based in nature, like a particular campaign (#BeThere) or a new legislation change (MISSION Act).
- This category of tier 2 content could be better served as a campaign landing page.

## Purpose

The purpose of this template is to enable an easy way for PW content team and VA businesses to create and manage this type of content in campaign landing page template in the new CMS, Drupal. 

### The template requirements are:
- It must allow 2 versions - image/visually rich vs. no images
- It must contain rigid locations for primary and secondary CTAs
- It must include links to related benefit hub content
- It must identify who the content is for and a summary (or tl;dr) section
- It must include the following optional content blocks that authors can include or omit, as needed:
    - section for video
    - section for downloadable PDF resources
    - section for stories (blog articles, announcements)
    - section for events
    - section for social media and other contact info
    - section for FAQs
    - these sections can be 1/0 (included/excluded) but not moved around or relocated on the template
