# Wizards: Discovery synthesis

*Liz Lantz, UX Designer/Researcher*

*DRAFT: last updated 3/6/2020*

## Problem statement

The Public Websites team is working to move/consolidate pre-requisite Wizard steps on Education and Disability content pages within the application tool landing page in order to:

1. Make the Veteran experience of starting their online application more seamless.
2. Make apply online CTAs from tier 2 content and other content outside of the benefit hubs more clear and direct.

[Our epic (#6315)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/6315) contains more details about the problem we're addressing.

## Discovery goals

In this stage of discovery, I seek to understand:

- Other than the 3 URLs in our epic, are there other pages within va.gov that have similar wizards leading to tools/forms we need to include?
- How did the wizards get to live on the content page rather than on the tool pages?
- What other options have been explored other than putting wizards directly on the content pages?

## Findings

### Answers to initial questions

**Other than the 3 URLs in our epic, are there other pages within va.gov that have similar wizards leading to tools/forms we need to include?**

Yes. The complete list of pages we will address with our work:

- https://va.gov/education/eligibility
- https://va.gov/disability/eligibility
- https://va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim
- https://va.gov/education/how-to-apply

**How did the wizards get to live on the content page rather than on the tool pages?**

- There was a very high rate of users completing the wrong forms, and it made sense to put the wizards on the pages where users ended up.
- This was a compromise because it was difficult to control how people got to the site, and there wasn't a way to tell if someone had already filled out the wizard

**What other options were explored when the decision was made to put the wizards on the content pages?**

- They had a "turbo tax" approach at one point (asking user if they want to be walked through or if the user wanted to go directly to the form)
  - Driven by stakeholder request because they didn't want to have to keep going through the wizard
  - Ultimately it was decided the wizard wasn't that hard to go through (although it has since grown)

**What prevents users from erroneously submitting other forms on va.gov that don't have these wizards?**

*will discuss w/ team*

### Additional information

- It is very difficult to find relevant research studies in our research history document. After dedicating a full day to combing through the existing research, I have decided to rely on conversations w/ the IA and UX resources available.
- We need to consider content pages that are specific to a form and link directly to the form itself, e.g. the [Fry Scholarship content page](https://www.va.gov/education/survivor-dependent-benefits/fry-scholarship/). Does a user need a wizard if they're coming from here?
- Veterans receive mailers with urls sending them directly to the online form (bypassing the wizard).
