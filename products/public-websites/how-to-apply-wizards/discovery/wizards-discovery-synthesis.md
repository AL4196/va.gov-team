# Wizards: Discovery Synthesis

*Liz Lantz, UX Designer/Researcher*

*DRAFT: last updated 3/9/2020*

## Problem Statement

We canâ€™t send users directly to online applications/tools to complete education benefit and disability claim forms because our critical pre-requisite wizards exist only content heavy pages.  

These wizards are sometimes so far down these pages, some users scroll right past them.

[Our epic (#6315)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/6315) contains business goals and more details about the problem we're addressing.

## Discovery Goals

In this stage of discovery, I seek to understand:

- Other than the 3 URLs in our epic, are there other pages within va.gov that have similar wizards leading to tools/forms we need to include?
- How did the wizards come to live on the content page rather than on the tool pages?
- What other options have been explored other than putting wizards directly on the content pages?

## Relevant Meetings

3/3/2020: Mikki Northius, IA (with Kelson Adams and Aruna Kucherlapati).  [Notes here.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/how-to-apply-wizards/discovery/20200303-ia-discovery.md)

## Findings

### Answers to initial questions

**Other than the 3 URLs in our epic, are there other pages within va.gov that have similar wizards leading to tools/forms we need to include?**

Yes. The complete list of pages we will address with our work:

- https://va.gov/education/eligibility
- https://va.gov/disability/eligibility
- https://va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim
- https://va.gov/education/how-to-apply

**How did the wizards come to live on the content page rather than on the tool pages?**

- There was a very high rate of users completing the wrong forms, and these content pages were where users were landing when looking for forms relevant to their task.
- This was a compromise, because it was difficult to control how people got to the site, and there wasn't a way to tell if someone had already filled out the wizard

**What other options were explored when the decision was made to put the wizards on the content pages?**

- They had a "turbo tax" approach at one point (asking user if they want to be walked through or if the user wanted to go directly to the form)
  - Driven by stakeholder request because they didn't want to have to keep going through the wizard
  - Ultimately it was decided the wizard wasn't that hard to go through (although it has since grown)

**What prevents users from erroneously submitting other forms on va.gov that don't have these wizards?**

*will discuss w/ team*

### Additional information

- It is very difficult to find relevant research studies in our research history document. After dedicating a full day to combing through the existing research, I have decided to rely on conversations w/ the IA and UX resources available.
- We need to consider content pages that are specific to a form and link directly to the form itself, e.g. the [Fry Scholarship content page](https://www.va.gov/education/survivor-dependent-benefits/fry-scholarship/). Does a user need a wizard if they're coming from here?
- Veterans receive mailers with urls sending them directly to the online form (bypassing the wizard).



## Next Steps

- Share findings with team week of 3/9
- Discuss initial solution ideas
