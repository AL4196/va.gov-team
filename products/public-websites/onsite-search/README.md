## User Problem Statement
Onsite search has not been revisited since the rebranding launch and transition from vets.gov to VA.gov. Since then many legacy pages and forms have been redirected to VA.gov., but a number of subdomains still exist and have not been brought in to the new VA.gov site experience. 

### User Goals
- Easily find and get to relevant, related information that helps veterans, caregivers, find what I am looking for the first time.

### Business Goals
- Create a cohesive brand across the VA through direct control of the search page layout and look
- Provide a more comprehensive sitemap (https://www.va.gov/site_map.htma) so search results are more accurate by allowing searching within a subdomain

## Assumptions
- Capturing click events and sending them back to search.gov will help prioritize indexing

## Scope 

## Solution Approach
   

## Value Propositions
- Reduces confusion for users navigating throughout the site
- Improves brand consistency for the VA
- Expands search results to include new and old pages
- Allows for full stylistic & functional control over the entire page and product
