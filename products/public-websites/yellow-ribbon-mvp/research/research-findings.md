## Research Goals 

Stated in the research plan:

- The primary goal of this research is to understand how Veterans research Yellow Ribbon Education benefits
- The secondary goal of this research is to understand what next steps a Veteran would want to take once they have completed research

The intention of this usability study was to better understand the factors that help Veterans make decisions on higher education, how they gather information to make those decicions, and how well they understand their education benefits.

Additionally, we sought to understand how Veterans are able to find school-specific Yellow Ribbon information, and how we might provide a more modernized experience than what is currently available on va.gov legacy pages.

## Research Methodology 

Sessions were a combined interview and task-based usability testing, via remote-moderation using Zoom, between January 30 - February 3, 2020.  Each session was approximately 40 minutes in length.

The moderator began with introduction questions and then prompted users to complete tasks with guiding questions (from the [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/yellow-ribbon-mvp/research/jan-2020-conversation-guide.md)).  Remote observers and note takers were also in attendance.

- To establish a baseline, 3 participants went through the tasks on the [existing Yellow Ribbon pages](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/yellow-ribbon-program/)
- The remaining 8 participants went through the tasks with a clickable prototype https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/X5VOMBG2YP4

The tasks specifically served to help us understand:

- how easily Veterans could find Yellow Ribbon information about schools they're interested in, and what might make it even easier for them to do so
- how easily Veterans could understand the benefit information for each school
- if comparison functionality would be useful to Veterans in this process
- how we can help Veterans achieve the next step in their research process

### Who we talked to

We spoke to 10 Veterans (referred to as “users”) who were geographically spread throughout the U.S. and demographically diverse. A full profile of users can be found in the appendix.

### Research Questions

- How might we provide an efficient, meaningful way for Veterans to evaluate their education options?
  - What role does YR participation play in their decision making process?
  - How well do Veterans understand YR benefits and how the program works?
  - How do Veterans currently look for Yellow Ribbon schools?
  - How do Veterans react to the existing Yellow Ribbon content presentation?
  - What information about Yellow Ribbon is most meaningful to Veterans?
  - What questions do they have as they go through this process?
  - What criteria do Veterans have set in their minds when they begin the research process?
  - How would filtering or sorting improve the experience for Veterans?
  - Is side-by-side comparison functionality useful at this stage in their research?
  - Should the data be presented differently at the research vs comparison phases?
- How might we empower Veterans to take the next step in their education process once they found the information needed to make a choice?
  - Once a Veteran has the Yellow Ribbon information they're looking for, what would they do next?

## Key Findings

1. Only 3 of the 10 users understood Yellow Ribbon benefits; half could not explain how the program works.

2. Primary factors when making are decision about higher education are area of study, degree level, and location. Yellow Ribbon benefits play a supporting role in this process.  Many users were also interested specifically in online programs.

3. Users have specific criteria in mind when researching benefits; they don't approach this task with a browsing mindset.

4. When conducting research around education and benefits, users primarily rely on Google to gather and verify information.  When asked to find Yellow Ribbon information on va.gov, only one user was able to find it without guidance or using the sitewide search. 

5. Users were able to complete research on Yellow Ribbon schools  with the current presentation of Yellow Ribbon information (accordion set listed by state containing links to individual state page with tabular list of schools). Comparison would be a manual process for them with this presentation.

6. Users were able to complete research on Yellow Ribbon schools, and compare options with the prototype.

7. Users found some language in the prototype confusing and/or ambiguous at first.  After looking through the search results, and comparing values against one another, they had a better guess as to what certain values meant, but weren't fully confident.

8. Once users identify Yellow Ribbon participating schools that offer the degree and program they're interested in, benefit amount and the likelihood of receiving that benefit were the most important pieces of information to users.

9. In order to complete research more efficiently, users would benefit from more specific criteria on the search page, or as filters on results, and more information on the comparison page.

10. The majority of users would want to get in touch with the school as a next step after researching and comparing schools.

    

## Details of Findings

1. Only 3 of the 10 users understood Yellow Ribbon benefits; half could not explain how the program works.  The few that fully understood the benefit had done their own research to come to that understanding.  One Veteran received the benefit without even knowing what it was - it just appeared on their tuition statement!  A participant with Traumatic Brain Injury and PTSD shared they have been struggling to understand the program and they've been unable to find information about the program in a way they can mentally digest. 
   - "Having a brain injury and PTSD, it's extremely important to me that it is set up in a format that's easy to understand without having to follow rabbit trails and click links, and call people, and do research. It gets too distracting" 
2. Primary factors when making are decision about higher education are area of study, degree level, and location. Yellow Ribbon benefits play a supporting role in this process.  Many users were also interested specifically in online programs. Once the user has made some selections based on the primary criteria, benefits that reduce out-of-pocket expenses play a larger role in narrowing down choices.
   - The majority of participants were focused on the Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit because of it's comprehensive coverage of education costs *and* housing.
   -  "It'll be a combination of cost, and who has the best program for what I'm looking for in our area"
   - From a user who transferred after the first year, and received Yellow Ribbon without asking for it: "I picked my schools based on convient location. Not a lot of choices in Alaska [where owned home], and then Methodist [second college] was in the same town as my fiancee and she said they had a good CS program, so that's why I chose them."
3. Users have specific criteria in mind when researching benefits; they don't approach this task with a  browsing mindset. 8 of the 10 users we spoke to stated they already had schools in mind when looking into their education benefits.  When asked what factors played into their selection process, users named:
   - Proximity of the school to their home or family
   - Offering the program and degree level they're interested in (e.g. Masters in Business Administration)
   - School ranking / quality of education
   - Learning format - multiple participants were interested only in online classes, and one was interested strictly in in-person learning environments
4. When conducting research around education and benefits, users primarily rely on Google to gather and verify information.  When asked to find Yellow Ribbon information on va.gov, only one user was able to find it without guidance or using the sitewide search.  
   - The participants who went to site search were able to find the Yellow Ribbon benefit information
   - Almost all users initially learned about their GI Bill benefits while enlisted, but don't currently rely on the VA for education or benefit information.  "I'd start on the VA website, and get confused and lost in the infinite pages that lead back to each other, and then just google and go to the military websites that essentially decrypt the VA website"
   - Many stated they would get in touch with the school directly to confirm information; specifically the admissions office, or the Veteran's Resource center at the school. "I would not go to a school that didn't have the experience running one of these [benefit] programs"
5. Users were easily able to complete research on Yellow Ribbon schools with the current presentation of Yellow Ribbon information (accordion set listed by state containing links to individual state page with tabular list of schools).  Because users would have schools in mind when seeking out Yellow Ribbon information, navigating by state was easy for them, and they quickly understood schools were listed alphabetically in the table.  2 of the 3 users commented that some kind of filter would be helpful, but they were still able to find what they were looking for.  Two pain points were identified:
   - One user expressed frustration having to contiunously scroll up and down to verify what the column he was looking at meant
   - Starting with a geographic location made it unintuitive to find online programs. "Trying to identify an online school by the state that it's based out of might make it difficult"
6. Users were easily able to complete research on Yellow Ribbon schools, and compare options with the prototype.  Multiple participants reacted postiively to the simplicity and straightforward presentation of the content on the intital landing screen.
7. Users found the language in the prototype confusing and/or ambiguous at first.  After looking through the search results, and comparing values against one another, they had a better guess as to what certain values meant, but were still unsure.
   - The **Maximum Benefit Amount** label left users unsure whether that applied to a specific period of time, and if so, what that timeframe might be.  
   - The term "**unlimited**" (benefit amount and number of students) was confusing to users who didn't have a strong understanding of how the Yellow Ribbon program worked (which was most of them)  *"What does unlimited mean? Everything has a limit."*
   - Users did not know what to expect from the search field labeled **School location, state, or campus**. *"All three of those are different, unless it'll list it as one option."*
   - **Degree Type** was also problematic. In the search field, users interpreted that to be more specific than the degree level. They expected to see specific programs such as "Masters in Business Administration".  On the results page, the word **All** was ambiguous to several users. "When it says degree type all, I don't know what that means...my assumption that is just a generic response. But there's no way these schools offer every kind of undergraduate degree"
8. Once a list of Yellow Ribbon participants schools had been presented, benefit amount and the likelihood of receiving that benefit were the most important pieces of information to users. Upon reading the "funding available for" number, many users asked some variaion of "what are my chances of actually getting this money?" and stated that would be an important factor in determining whether or not they'd want to move foward with that school. 
   - "If I'm applying to the school, I'm definitely going to ask how many students did you already give the funding to"
9. In order to complete research more efficiently, users would benefit from more specific criteria on the search page, or as filters on results, and more information on the comparison page.  Because users have specific criteria in mind when verifying benefits, allowing them to input all of that criteria at some point in the process will return a more relevant, and smaller, set of results for them to sort through. 
   - Almost all users stated they would search by program type
   - 
10. The majority of users would want to get in touch with the school as a next step after researching and comparing schools.

## Additional Insights

- Users had a difficult time finding Yellow Ribbon information through va.gov IA.  

- Many resorted to site search when they were unsuccessful after 2-3 clicks on hub pages.

- Most users first clicked on the Education heading when looking for this information.

- confusion around "decision" on hub page...what are deciding factors? what increases changes?

## Recommendations

- Improve outreach effots to increase awareness around the benefits available to Veterans, and how they can use it
- Allow users to enter more specific criteria when conducting the intial search
- Explore how we might allow users to filter by the data points available for each school (program, degree, benefit amount, number of students)
- Improve clarity of content across the product
  - **Maximum Yellow Ribbon Benefit Amount** should go back to **Maximum Yellow Ribbon Benefit Amount (per student, per year)** 
  - Change how **Degree type** is handled. Update label to **Degree Level** (or something similar) , and add a field for program / area of study
  - Explore ways we can update the word "all" to be more specific, given the constraints with the data we have access to
- Additional opportunities for research
