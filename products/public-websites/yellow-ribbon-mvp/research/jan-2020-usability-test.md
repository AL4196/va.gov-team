# Research Plan for Yellow Ribbon Comparison Tool

Public Websites team, Yellow Ribbon (YR) content migration

## Goals	

- The primary goal of this research is to understand how Veterans research Yellow Ribbon Education benefits
- The secondary goal of this research is to understand what next steps a Veteran would want to take once they have completed research

### Background

- Yellow Ribbon funding is a component of the Post 9/11 GI-Bill education benefit that awards Veterans additional funds toward their education.  Schools who participate in YR agree to contribute a dollar amount toward tuition for a set number of applicants, and the VA matches those funds for the beneficiary.  More details about the program are available in the [Education Benefit Hub](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/yellow-ribbon-program/)
- The current front end (FE) experience requires users to navigate one page per state ([example here](https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/yellow_ribbon/2019/states/ca.asp)) and manually search a static table to find benefit information.  Our MVP seeks to improve this experience with a dynamic tool that Veterans can use to find schools they're interested in, and select a few to compare.
- Yellow Ribbon information is also available in the [GI Bill Comparison Tool](https://www.va.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool/) (GIBCT) via the GI Data Service (GIDS), but the YR data hasn't been updated since November 2018.  Process updates are underway so that GIDS will be updated in early 2020 (target Jan).
- The GIBCT, maintained by the Booz-Allen Hamilton (BAH) team, is slated for updates in 2020.  Those updates may include improving the YR user experience. Our MVP will serve as the primary method for Veterans to find YR information until the GIBCT has a comparable experience.

### Research questions

- How might we provide an efficient, meaningful way for Veterans to evaluate their education options?
  - What role does YR participation play in their decision making process?
  - How well do Veterans understand YR benefits and how the program works? 
  - How do Veterans currently look for Yellow Ribbon schools?
  - How do Veterans react to existing Yellow Ribbon presentation?
  - What information about Yellow Ribbon is most meaningful to Veterans?
  - What questions do they have as they go through this process?
  - What criteria do Veterans have set in their minds when they begin the research process?
  - How would filtering improve the experience for Veterans?
  - Is side-by-side comparison functionality useful at this stage in their research?
  - Should the data be presented differently at the research vs comparison phases?
- How might we empower Veterans to take the next step in their education process once they found the information needed to make a choice?
  - Once a Veteran has the Yellow Ribbon information they're looking for, what would they do next?

### Hypothesis

- Veterans find the current presentation of YR information tedious to parse through
- Veterans know the degree level, and either city, state, or name of the school they're interested in when they begin their research
- Sorting, filtering, and side-by-side comparison functionality will be helpful for Veterans 
- Benefit amount will be the most important variable in the search results
- Veterans will be confused about the difference between this and the GIBCT, and not understand the need for two separate tools

## Method	

- Research will take place in the form of combined interview and task-based usability testing
- Users will engage with a live tool in our staging environment
- The sessions will be remote-modterated using Zoom. This method will allow us to observe users using our solution in their own environment, as well as test participants across geographic areas.	

## Participants and Recruitment	

### Criteria

- 12 participants who are familiar with the Yellow Ribbon program and,
  - have used the Yellow Ribbon benefit within the last 12 months, or 
  - are currently in the process of researching VA education benefits
- To ensure a diverse group of participants, we request a mix of enlisted and officer (for socio-economic diversity), and geographic assortment.  Also, that of the 12, we have at least: 
  - 2 female participants
  - 1 participant with a disability rating of 70% or more
  - 1 participant who uses assistive technology (AT), such as screen readers, switches, translation, or magnification software (list of sample AT: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/examples-of-assistive-tech.md)


### Recruitment strategy 	

Will work with Perigean for recruiting
