## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about Yellow Ribbon education benefits, and how you, as someone eligible to receive them, go about finding Yellow Ribbon schools. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions  - X minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

### For participants who have already used the Yellow Ribbon benefit:

- I understand you've used your education benefits, which is great. Are you currently in school?
- If yes:
  - Where are you going to school, and what degree are you going for?
- If no:
  - Where did you go to school, and what degree did you receive?
- How did you decide on that school and area of study?
- Did you consider or apply any other schools? I'd love to learn more about your research and decision process once you knew you wanted to go to school
  - How did Yellow Ribbon benefits play into your decision?
  - Was it clear to you how Yellow Ribbon fit with your other education benefits?
  - What specific methods did you use to research schools, and your VA education benefits?
- If you can think back to when you were first contemplating going to school, or beginning the application process:
  - Do you recall how you first learned what VA education benefits were available to you, and how Yellow Ribbon fit into those benefits?
  - *(if this does not come out of "how did you decide on that school...")* Do you recall the factors that made you want to apply to a specific school?
  - Were there any parts of the process that were particurlarly confusing? If so, how did you get clarification?

### For participants who are in the process of researching their education benefits:

- I understand you're considering going to school, and using your VA education benefits. That's great! Where are you in that process?

- How have you found colleges you're interested in applying to? 

- What factors make you want to apply to a specific school?

- What has your process been to research the benefits available to you, and schools where you can utilize those benefits?

- How does Yellow Ribbon fit into your decision making process as you choose schools to apply to?

  

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*

## First Task: Find relevant schools in legacy Yellow Ribbon tables - X minutes

- Start on Yellow Ribbon benefit hub page.
- Find a school they're interested in, and tell me the information they find about it in terms of Yellow Ribbon
  - If participant is interested in a state with a very small number of rows, once they have completed the task, ask them to react to a state like California with numerous rows.

### Things to watch for:

- Are the accordions easy for the participate to understand and navigate?
- How does the participant navigate the table? (Ctrl+f, manual scroll, etc)
- What emotions/thoughts does the participant verbalize while looking at a table presentation of this data?

## Second Task: Find relevant schools in prototype - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson?
