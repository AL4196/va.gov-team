### Project-specific setup

- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about Yellow Ribbon education benefits, and how you, as someone eligible to receive them, understand your benefits and you go about using them.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.  The more you can think out loud and share what you're thinking as you go through the session, the better.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions  - 5-8 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

### For participants who have already used the Yellow Ribbon benefit:

- I understand you've used your education benefits, which is great. Are you currently in school?
- Where are/did you going to school, and what degree?
- How did you decide on that school and area of study?
- Did you consider or apply any other schools? I'd love to learn more about your research and decision process once you knew you wanted to go to school.
  - Was it clear to you how Yellow Ribbon fit with your other education benefits?
  - How did Yellow Ribbon benefits play into your decision?
  - What specific methods did you use to research schools, and your VA education benefits?
- If you can think back to when you were first contemplating going to school, or beginning the application process:
  - Do you recall how you first learned what VA education benefits were available to you, and how Yellow Ribbon fit into those benefits?
  - *(if this does not come out of "how did you decide on that school...")* Do you recall the factors that made you want to apply to a specific school?
  - Were there any parts of the process that were particurlarly confusing? If so, how did you get clarification?

### For participants who are in the process of researching their education benefits:

- I understand you're considering going to school, and using your VA education benefits. That's great! Where are you in that process?

- How have you found colleges you're interested in applying to? 

- What factors make you want to apply to a specific school?

- What has your process been to research the benefits available to you, and schools where you can utilize those benefits?

  - Have you encountered anything that made it harder, or easier, to do this research?
  - Once you've got all the information you need, what will your next step be?

- How does Yellow Ribbon fit into your decision making process as you choose schools to apply to?

  

## First Task: Find relevant schools in legacy Yellow Ribbon tables - 5 minutes

- Start on Yellow Ribbon benefit hub page **on production**.
- Find a school they're interested in, and tell me the Yellow Ribbon benefit information for that school
  - *If participant is interested in a state with a very small number of rows, once they have completed the task, ask them to react to a state like California with numerous rows.*

### Things to watch for:

- How does the participant understand and navigate the accordion pattern?
- How does the participant navigate the table on the state page? (Ctrl+f, manual scroll, etc)
- What emotions/thoughts does the participant verbalize while looking at a table presentation of this data?

## Second Task: Conduct a search in prototype - 5  minutes

**Participant question:** *so far we've looked at this information on a desktop computer.  Do you normally conduct this kind of research on a desktop computer, or would you access this on your phone?*

- Direct participant to mobile or desktop prototype, based on response above

- Take a look at the content on this page. Tell me what you think this page is for, what you can do here.  Think aloud as you look.
- What are your thoughts on the search criteria?
- Let's imagine you live in California, and you're interested in finding an in-state school for a Bachelor's degree. Go ahead and see if you can find that.

- After results are presented:

  - Again, take a look at the content on this page. Don't click on anything just yet.  Tell me what you're looking at, what you can do here.  Think aloud as you look.
  - Imagine you wanted to see this list in a different order, such has highest benefit amount first. How would you do that?
  - Does the information about each school feel complete to you?
  - Is the meaning of each piece of information in the card clear to you?
  - If you wanted to see the next set of schools, how would you do that?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the particpant understand what this tool is for?

- How does the participant react to the search criteria fields required to begin?

- After results are presented:

  - Does the participant notice without being prompted that they can sort the search results? Reaction to sort options?
  - Can the participant comfortably read the information presented in the cards?
  - Does the participant understand the information, specifically the number of students?
  - Does the participant notice the Add to Compare button?

  

## Third Task: Compare schools and change criteria - 8 minutes

- Let's say you're interested in [School A, School B, and School C] , and you want to see which one offers Yellow Ribbon to the most students.  How would you do that?
  - *If student does not use add to compare button and make their way to the comparison table, guide them there*
- Tell me about this screen - what do you see here, what do you think you can do?
- What are your thoughts on the way this information is presented?
- If you wanted to update this list somehow, how would you do that?
- Now that you have this information about these schools, what would your next step be?
- Imagine you want to go back and search for something different, maybe a specific school, or a different kind of degree.  How would you do that?

### Things to watch for:

- Why didn't they notice the Add to compare button?
- How many schools does the participant want to compare?
- Which data points is the participant most interested in comparing?
- Does the participant understand how to update their comparison?
- What would the participants next step be, once they have all the information about the school they're interested in?
- Does the participant understand how to start a new search?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Do you have any other thoughts or feedback you haven't had a chance to share yet?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
