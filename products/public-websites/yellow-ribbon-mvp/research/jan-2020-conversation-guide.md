### Project-specific setup

- [ ] Start at va.gov
- [ ] Begin screen sharing

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about Yellow Ribbon education benefits, and how you, as someone eligible to receive them, understand your benefits and go about using them.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 40 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.  The more you can think out loud and share what you're thinking as you go through the session, the better.
- **For second participant group**
  - **You'll be interacting with an interactive prototype.** This is means it may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions  - 10 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

### For participants who have already used the Yellow Ribbon benefit:

- I understand you've used your education benefits, which is great. Are you currently in school?
- Where are/did you going to school, and what degree?
- I'd love to hear about your research and decision process once you knew you wanted to go to school.
  - What stage of your military service were you in when you decided to go to school?
  - How many schools did you apply to?
  - What information was important to you as you narrowed down your school choices? 
  - Why did you ultimately choose [that school], and area of study?
  - I understand you've used the Yellow Ribbon benefit. Tell me how that benefit works.
  - How did Yellow Ribbon benefits play into your decision?
  - What specific methods did you use to research schools, and your VA education benefits?

### For participants who are in the process of researching their education benefits:

- I understand you're considering going to school, and using your VA education benefits. That's great! Where are you in that process?
- Do you know what you want to study?
- I'd love to hear about your research and decision process so far.
  - What stage of your military service were you in when you decided to go to school?
  - How many schools are you planning on applying to?
  - What information is most important to you as you decide which schools to apply to?
  - How have you done your research on schools so far? 
  - How about research on the education benefits available to you?
  - Have you encountered anything that made it harder, or easier, to do this research?
  - Are you familiar with the Yellow Ribbon benefit? *(**see note below**)* 
    - *If yes:* Tell me how it works.
    - *If no*: Are you familiar with any education benefits you can get through the VA?
      * If not, may need to 
  - How does it fit into your decision making process?

***If participants aren't familiar with any education benefits, give succinct description of what Yellow Ribbon program benefits are, and skip next section***

###For participants with benefit familiarity:

- How did you first learn what VA education benefits were available to you, and how Yellow Ribbon fit into those benefits?
- Were there any parts of the process that were particurlarly confusing? If so, how did you get clarification?
- Imagine I don't know anything about VA benefits. Can you tell me how the Yellow Ribbon program works?

We're almost ready to move to the website/prototype now, and I'll ask you to try some things related to finding schools and understanding Yellow Ribbon benefits. Before we jump in, can you tell me where you would typically conduct this type of research?


## First task: find relevant Yellow Ribbon schools - 8 minutes

- Go to va.gov.  You're interested in finding out about Yellow Ribbon program benefits. How would you find that information from here?
- ***Once on Yellow Ribbon benefit hub page***: Take a look at the content on this page.  I'm interested in your impressions of this page. Tell me what you think it is for, what you can do here.  You can scroll up and down, but don't click on anything just yet. Please think out loud as you look around.
  - You're interested in finding participating schools you might want to attend. Show me how you would do this.  Again, please think aloud as you go through this.
  - **For prototype:** 
    - Since we're gathering feedback on a prototype, this page isn't linked directly to it. I'm going to send you a link via the chat now. https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/X5VOMBG2YP4
    - Now take a look at the content on this page; again, I'm interested in your feedback so please think aloud.  Tell me what you think this page is for, and what you can do here.
    - Show me how you'd find participating schools you might want to attend from here.

### Things to watch for:

- How does participant navigate to the education hub? 
- Is it challenging for the participant to find the Yellow Ribbon program information?
- On current Yellow Ribbon page:
  - How does the participant understand and navigate the accordion pattern?
- On prototype:
  - Any reaction to search criteria?
  - Does the participant understand the fields are optional?

## Second task: review school results - 5 minutes

- Again, take a look at the content on this page. Don't click on anything just yet.  Tell me what you're looking at, what you can do here.  Think aloud as you look.
- How would you use the information here to make any decisions about schools you might want to attend?
- You've heard of a school called Xavier University nearby, and want to see if it offers Yellow Ribbon. How would you find that out?
- You want to reduce the number of options you have to go through. Show me how would you do that.
- Now, show me how you would change the order.
- What would you do next, now that you see this list of results?

### Things to watch for:

- How does the participant navigate the tables on the current YR page? (Ctrl+f, manual scroll, etc)

- Does the participant experience any confusion or frustration about the information presentation on the page?

- **Prototype specific** Does the particpant understand what this tool is for?

- Does the participant express any desire for sorting or filtering functionality?

  - Can the participant comfortably read the information presented in the cards?
  - Does the participant understand the information, specifically the number of students?
  - Does the participant notice the Add to Compare button?

  

## Third Task (current YR pages): compare schools  - 5 minutes

- You're interested in going to school for a graduate degree, and you want to see which schools offer that degree, along with the largest benefit amount.  How would you do that?
- Which pieces of information are you most interested in as you try to choose between schools?
- Now that you have this information about these schools, what would the next step be for you?
- You want to go back and search for something different, maybe another location, or a different kind of degree.  How would you do that from here?

### Things to watch for:

- How does the participant attempt to compare schools in a table presentation?
- Any indication of how many schools the participant wants to compare?
- Which data points is the participant most interested in comparing?
- What would the participants next step be, once they have all the information about the school they're interested in?
- How does the participant go back?



## Third Task (prototype): Compare schools and change criteria - 8 minutes

- You're interested in going to school to study art, and you want to see which schools might have that program, with the largest benefit amount.  How would you do that?
- *Once on comparison screen*: Tell me what you see here - what do you see, and what do you think you can do?
- Which pieces of information are you most interested in as you try to choose between schools?
- Show me how you would update this list.
- Now that you've seen this information, what would the next step be for you?
- You want to go back and search for something different, maybe a specific school, or a different kind of degree.  How would you do that?
- If you used the breadcrumb, what would you expect to see on the search results page?
- Go back to the results screen (screen with "Added" button) - what do you think would happen if you clicked on the button under Chicago State University? (*should have added state applied to it*)

#### Things to watch for:

- Did the participant understand how to navigate to this page from the search results?
- Any indication of how many schools the participant wants to compare?
- Which data points is the participant most interested in comparing?
- Does the participant understand how to update their comparison?
- What would the participants next step be, once they have all the information about the school they're interested in?
- Does the participant understand how to start a new search?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- If extra time - mobile version compare drop down?
- If session did not cover, be sure to ask:
  - On the first page of the prototype, did you feel you had the right criteria to search by?
  - Any feedback on filtering or refining the list of schools?
- Do you have any other thoughts or feedback you haven't had a chance to share yet?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
