# Notifications

This includes:

1. Internal notifications â€” Notifications that live on VA.gov
2. External notifications - Email, text
  - Potentially could include management of paper mail

# Internal notifications 

## MVP

**In scope**

- How notifications will work on VA.gov
  - Status updates (no action required)
  - Time sensitive updates (action required)

## Things we need to figure out

- The potential notifications do could we show on VA.gov
- Where notifications live
  - If there is a separate notification center, or whether notifications live on the new logged in homepage
  - Whether notifications also live on tool pages (either some or all of the time)
- How to mark a notification as read
- Whether there is any kind of archive of notifications (and if so long, how far back it goes)
- What the overall flow would look like when we have external notifications

## User questions we have

- Are internal notifications helpful, or do people only want external notifications?
- Where do users expect to see status update/time-sensitive notifications on VA.gov?

## Potential discovery activities

- Create an inventory of all existing status/time-sensitive updates we currently have on the site (My VA).
- Create an inventory of other potential notifications we could add over time.
- Some sort of user research.
- Competitive analysis of notification behaviors.

## Other

- Is there anything useful in [this doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Notifications/Full%20list%20of%20potential%20and%20existing%20notifications.xlsx)?

## External notifications

## What we need to do 

- Take inventory of all existing notifications we have on the website
- Figure out all possible notifications we could show
