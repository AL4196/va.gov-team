## DISCOVERY BRIEF

### Problem Statement / How Might We statements

The login experience on VA.gov today is tailored specifically to the Veteran persona. We're at the point now, where in order to continue expanding the VA.gov experience to meet additional use cases, we need to expand identity to work for more personas who might be using VA.gov to do things on behalf of a Veteran or for themselves: Caregivers, Representatives, Dependents, and people who are multiple persona types at once (like someone who is both a Veteran and Dependent). There are limitations in the way the Identity solution is set up today, that prevents VA.gov teams from delivering functionality that adequately meets needs of these new personas and use cases.

- How might we leverage existing examples of "delegation" (from MHV) to enhance VA.gov's identity solution to enable users to log in and perform actions on behalf of one or many Veterans?

- How might we update the way we handle user types to enable VA.gov to better customize the experience (i.e. Caregiver, i.e. Dependents, etc)?

### What Sprint Teams Are Associated with this Discovery? 
- VSP-Identity

## What other teams are simultaneously working on Identity solutions?
- SSO/Login Integration (SSOe?)
- eBenefits
- Caregiver team
- Authenticated Experience team
- VA Online Scheduling team

## What are the priorities of these other teams?

- Delegation
- DS Logon is a barrier to access
- Password requirements are burdensome
- Veterans and caregivers desire a single, better system
- Veterans want secure, trustworthy systems
- Caregivers lack the access they need
- DS Logon is perceived as outdated and dysfunctional
- Login support
- Mobile access
- Veterans have little memory of account set-up

## How might our (Platform) priorities be similar or different?


## Who are the stakeholders?

#### VA Stakeholders
- MHV Delegation team
- IAM?
- MCT?
- DEPO / USDS?

#### Beta users
- Likely authenticated experience team

#### Other teams leading other Identity solutions
- 

#### Systems we're dependent upon

### Project Details

* What do we know?
* What don't we know?
* Are any of the above assumptions that need to be verified?
* How are we going to find out answers? (There are tons of different methods to choose from depending on your project goals, resources, and time constraints. Checkout the methods and templates provided in the [Discovery Toolkit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/how-to-run-discovery-sprint.md) and consult the [Research Team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/research).)
* What kinds of users are likely to benefit from solving this problem (bonus points for our personas)?
* Who do we need to talk to (stakeholders, Veterans, MHV Coordinators, etc.)? (Try to get a wide variety of people to get a range of perspectives â€“ both higher ups and people on the ground doing the work. Meet with people in person whenever possible.)
* What secondary research should we do (google, facebook, internal documents)?
* Are there any intentional project constraints (things we're intentionally deeming out of scope)?
* Are there any challenges or risks that will make this discovery sprint hard to complete (tricky politics, technology complications, etc.)?


### Timeline
