## Background 

Prior to Spring 2018, the Vets.gov logged in experience was limited to an account page that aggregated a fraction of the personalized information we had available on the site at the time. Through extensive research done by the Veteran Experience Office and other partners, we knew that veterans wanted to manage all benefited-related information in one place, so the newly-formed dragons/personalization team set out to create a more robust logged in experience. The My VA dashboard was launched as part of this effort and included four features — Your Applications, Track Claims, Secure Messaging, and Prescription Refills — along with links to personal records and the newly-created profile and account settings pages. 

Since then, the dashboard has grown, adding the Find VA Benefits tool and health care application tracking and enrollment statuses. But with the addition of these new features, the dashboard's single-column, content page-like design has quickly become cumbersome, long, and hard to navigate. Additionally, the information architecture of the MVP dashboard divided sections by content type (eg. applications and claims) instead of by benefit, which has made it hard to track progress across a benefit lifecycle.

To explore these problems, the dragons/personalization team conducted user interviews in July 2019 to learn more about how people use the My VA dashboard and how we could improve this page. 

## Methods

### What We Did

We began the dashboard 2.0 research with a round of user interviews that aimed to explore how veterans manage benefits and use the existing My VA dashboard and VA.gov homepage. These conversations focused on the following questions:

- How do veterans want to find, track, and manage their benefits? What might happen on the dashboard vs. other places?
- How do people use the existing dashboard?
- What do people find helpful and useful on the existing dashboard? What, if anything, is unhelpful?
- How do people feel about the existing dashboard IA? Would they prefer for the dashboard to be organized by benefit?
- What causes confusion?
- How can the dashboard be improved so that it is more useful and usable to veterans? What can we add, change, or take away?
- Do veterans use the current homepage in favor of My VA? Would veterans prefer that My VA and the VA.gov homepage be one in the logged in experience?
- What have we not considered? What do we not know that we don't know?

### Tools

We conducted user interviews via GoToMeeting. We also had participants sign in to their VA.gov accounts so we could discuss how they manage VA benefits and how they use the My VA personalized dashboard. 

### Dates

We conducted interviews between July 8, 2019 – July 15, 2019.

### Participants

We talked to **6 veterans**:

- All participants received at least one benefit from the VA.
  - Most participants received disability compensation and health care.
  - One participant only received VA health care and reported that she did not receive disability compensation.
- 5 women; 1 man.
- 3 participants 45 – 54; 1 participant 55 – 64; 1 participant 65 – 74; 1 participant did not diclose their age range
- 3 Navy; 1 Marine; 1 Air Force; 1 Army
- 4 white participants; 1 Asian participant; 1 participant did not disclose their race/ethnicity

## Results & Takeaways

### People don't use — or even know about — the My VA dashboard

Qualitatively, all of the people we spoke with had never used the My VA dashboard, and those who had used it were not using it readily and reported they did not have much of a need for it (P1, P3, P4, P5, P6). 

Quantitatively, we confirmed this with analytics. From 1/1/19 - 7/14/19, there were 160,010,637 page views on VA.gov as a whole. Of that, the homepage had 25,286,165 (15%) views, and My VA had 4,127,632 (2%) views. 

### The tools on My VA are useful, but most of them can be accessed from the homepage 

A large majority of the links that are included in the top 20 tasks on the homepage are also on the the My VA dashboard, making many of the duplicative. 

### People use MHV to manage health care. Some find the content we are showing on My VA to be duplicative or unhelpful because of this.

For the health care users we spoke with (P1, P3, P4, P5, P6), all of them go directly to My HealtheVet to manage their health care. While some appreciated that we show this information on My VA (P1, P5, P6), some reported this made the My VA dashboard feel duplicative (P3, P4) and that they don't need the information we're bubbling up on the My VA dashboard.

### Some people reported liking the dashboard, and some even said it would be helpful to "merge" it with the homepage. But all of the participants still said they preferred the homepage over My VA.

Some participants (P1, P5, P6) like the My VA dashboard and said they were impressed by it, even though they didn't use it or didn't know it was there. Some participants (P3, P4) actively did not like the My VA dashboard because of the design or because they felt it was duplicative of content elsewhere. Despite whether people were in the like/dislike camps, almost all participants said it would be a positive move to merge the My VA dashboard and the homepage except for one person (P3). However, despite people generally being pro-merging these two pages, all participants said they preferred the design of the homepage from a visual design/clarity/simplicity perspective.

### Organizing information by benefit makes sense to people for the dashboard

When asked whether people preferred to organize the My VA dashboard by task type, people wanted to see information by benefit and felt that this more closely matched their mental models.

### VA.gov users are task oriented, and they don't come to the site to browse or check-in without a reason

It is worth reminding ourselves that VA.gov is not a place people come to browse, and this is further reinenforced in research, where people report that they only come to VA.gov or other VA properties when they have to complete a specific task. Furthermore, people did not report a need to check the status of their benefits unless they were expecting an update (eg. if they were tracking a claim). This makes the My VA dashboard less neccessary, since people use can the VA.gov homepage to route to common tasks and pages that show the status of benefits like disability and education.

## Recommendation

**TL;DR**

Consider retiring the My VA dashboard in favor of adding some personalized content to the logged in VA.gov homepage. For content that doesn't make sense to add to the homepage in its current iteration, rethink those experiences from a logged in and logged out perspective (eg. Find VA Benefits).

**The longer narrative**

As mentioned in the background section of this write-up, the personalized dashboard was created for Vets.gov because there was essentially no logged in experience. It was a huge win at the time — it aggregated personalized features that were on Vets.gov and made them easy to find. It routed people to many of the top 20 tasks that now exist on the VA.gov homepage but didn't exist in one place on Vets.gov.

But now that VA.gov has launched, the My VA dashboard feels like it has become obsolete. Given that many of the links on My VA are already present on the homepage, My VA is largely duplicative, and for the content that is not duplicated on the homepage, there is not enough of a user need to keep My VA around just for that content.

Instead of focusing on aggregating personalized content into a singular dashboard, the personalization team should be placing more emphasis on personalized content in context where site users need it. Going forward, a greater emphasis should be placed on flow and engaging users where they are with effective communication. 

## Next Steps

### Talk to service members preparing for separation

Separating service members were not represented in this research, and we don't want to leave this group behind. We need to learn about their unique needs and incorporate those findings into the personalized experience on VA.gov.

### Complete a card sort

We want this research to go beyond the dashboard to consider the full personalized suite, which includes the existing profile and account settings pages. Through a card sort, we can better understand how users would approach various pieces of personalized content on VA.gov and how we should organize that content going forward.

### Complete a comparative analyis

Though our team has completed various comparative analyses in the past, we want to approach this process with a fresh set of eyes and see what new lessons we can learn from how other sites handle dashboards and personalization more broadly.
