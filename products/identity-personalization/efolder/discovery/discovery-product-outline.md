## User Problem Statement:

Veterans currently do not have any visibility into their eFolder beyond the documents they themselves upload to support their claims. As a result, it is hard for them when applying for a variety of benefits, which require certain documentation or proof-of-service types of documentation, as Veterans don't have clarity about what the VA already has or how to get it. 

**Phase 1: EBenefits Parity**: On Vets.gov, Veterans cannot see the documents that they upload as part of a benefit application. Veterans need to be able to see their documents in an accessible section on the website. 
**Phase 2: Fully Exposed eFolder**: Veterans cannot see the full body of documents in their VA eFolders. If they are able to access these files via FOIA requests, it is hard to organize the potentially hundreds of documents in the eFolder. 

## User Story: 

### Phase I User Stories: 
- As a Veteran I want to be able to see the documents that I upload to eFolder in a documents section on my Vets.gov profile. 
- As a Veteran, I want to be able to upload documents from My Documents or my computer as I am filling out an application on Vets.gov.

### Phase II User Stories: 
- As a Veteran, I need to know all of the documents the VA already has on file for me and be able to access them to apply for VA benefits. 
- As a Veteran, I need to be able to identify and find a document in my eFolder when I need it for a benefit application. 
- As a representative of the VA, I am spending a lot of LOE responding to Veteran Privacy Act/FOIA requests; Veterans should be able to access their own information. 

## Goal of discovery
1. Understand the root cause of the problem statements. 
**Phase I: EBenefits Parity**
- How do Veterans currently use the "My Documents" section on eBenefits? What works? What are their pain points? 
- What are the user journeys through which a Veteran would want to tap into their eFolder while applying for a benefit? 

**Phase II: Fully Exposed eFolder**
- How do Veterans currently gather evidence for their benefit applications? What works? What are their pain points?
- When a Veteran makes a FOIA request, why do they make that request? What do they do with the information once they receive it? Does it make any sense? 
- How do Veterans classify the documents they receive? How do they organize them? What nomenclature do they use? 
- How might a Veteran flag a document that is missing? How about a document that has been misclassified in their eFolder? 
- What do Veterans want to do if they are presented with another Veteran's PII as part of their eFolder? 
- How do VSOs, private attorney groups, or state rep groups help Veterans gather evidence? How do they help Veterans understand what evidence is important to include or NOT include? 
- What is technically possible with regard to organizing the documents? Can we scan documents to help inform metadata? Can we apply eFX's nomenclature without the download function? What is the digital approach to the assistants' efforts to clean documents before delivering them to Veterans? 

2. Research existing tools (digital or otherwise) for aiding benefit discovery
**What can we reuse or build off of?** 

**What prior successes or failures can we learn from?**

## What we know

**What is the problem?**

**Why is this a problem?**

## To investigate
- Why does this problem happen? What evidence do we have?

## How we'll get answers
### Phase I:
- Observe Veterans using their current eFolder on EBN
- Talk to DSVA/Vets.gov Stakeholders
- Talk to VA Stakeholders
- Heuristic research on existing document management solutions
- Review existing research on EFX, including demo

### Phase II:
- Interviews & journey mapping with Veterans about evidence-gathering process
- Interviews with Veterans who have made privacy act requests
- Card sorting exercises with Veterans about document organization/nomenclature
- Interviews with VSOs, attorney groups, state rep groups on their evidence gathering / supporting process
- Observation of VA staff who are processing claims, FOIA requests
- Appeals Team past and current research 
- Vets.gov research archive, including baseline research
- Technical research on universe of possibilities. 

## Solution Approach: 

## Additional Existing Research
- Appeals Research
- EFolder Express research
