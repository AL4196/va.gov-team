## What is CSS?
CSS is the Common Security System and is owned by the Office of Business Process and Integration. It is a central login system that sits on top of required applications, which usually means that the app interacts with their API. There is another application called CSEUM that serves as the access point and database of authorized users in CSS. Each station, such as ours 101, has CSEUM initiator that grants access to applications using CSEUM.

## How does Caseflow interact with CSS?
In terms of Caseflow, we donâ€™t own any of these systems. We have initiators for our station and interact with their API

## Who is our CSS SME and knows all the things related to this process?
