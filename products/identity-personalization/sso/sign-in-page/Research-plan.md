# Research Plan for SSO, Alert Updates on VA.gov Manage Benefit Pages, February 14, 2020

1. **What product & team?** SSO
2. **Background**: 5 Manage Benefit Pages need to be updated from linking to just My HealtheVet to linking to both My VA Health (Cerner) and My HealtheVet. To start, Cerner users will also need to use My HealtheVet to manage any care received at a non-Cerner facility or any health records older than 3 years. Our research objective is to discover if design directions for alert box updates enable participants to understand what the arrival of My VA Health means for managing health benefits online via VA.gov Manage Benefits pages.
3. **Research questions**: Do our screens enable participants to comprehend the arrival of My VA Health?What, if anything, do participants find unclear? What questions or feedback do participants have about My VA Health? Does one direction facilitate comprehension more than the others? Why?
4. **Hypothesis**: We expect that Veterans will have some questions about what My VA Health is, what it might mean for their care, and why they need to use it. We expect that Veterans may have some confusion over the similar names of My VA Health and My HealtheVet. We expect that Veterans might question why they can no longer see comprehensive views of care received across facilities within one management portal. Veterans may see the tool as duplicative. 



## Method 

1. What method of research are you planning? Remote, moderated feedback session and comprehension testing with medium-fidelity Invision prototype.
2. Why this method? Ideally, we would like to test these design options with We will also be inviting Stakeholders to observe and participate in deriving insights. Coordinating this co-creation remotely will enable more stakeholder participation.
3. Where are you planning to do your research? We will use the Perigean **GoToMeeting** account to enable participants to take over screen control. Because our first prototype will low-fidelity, this will allow us to more easily intercept to reset the Veteran if needed.
4. What will you be testing? We will be testing a prototype that will be shared digitally via Mural or Invision.
