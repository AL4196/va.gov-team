# SSOe Release Plan

---

## Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)
_Is this something we can implement with SSO using sticky feature flagging?_

### Planning:
- Desired date range or test duration: [date - date] or [duration]
- Desired number of users: x
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: lorem ipsum
- How you'll conduct the testing: lorem ipsum
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: lorem ipsum

### Results:
- Number of users: x
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: x/x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

## Phase II: unmoderated production testing

### Planning - Outbound (SSOe is live for users logging in on VA.gov and then navigating elsewhere):
- Desired date range: 4/1/20 - 4/6/20
- Desired number of unique users: XX% (20%?) of total logins per day (~2.6M total and 2.2M unique over this time period)
- How you'll make the product available in production while limiting the # of users who can find/access it: Sticky feature flagging
- "Success" criteria (by the numbers): [use your KPIs to help guide this. It could be things like abondomnent rate < 20%, reported contact center calls < 2 calls, error rate < 5%, etc.]

### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Actual results (per your "success criteria")
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
