# SSOe Release Plan

---

## Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)
N/A for this feature release.



## Phase II: unmoderated production testing

### Planning - Outbound (SSOe is live for users logging in on VA.gov and then navigating elsewhere):
- Desired date range: 4/8/20 - 4/10/20
- Desired number of unique users: We plan to start with 1% of users and gradually increase users over two days.
- How you'll make the product available in production while limiting the # of users who can find/access it: Sticky feature flagging
- "Success" criteria (by the numbers): [use your KPIs to help guide this. It could be things like abondomnent rate < 20%, reported contact center calls < 2 calls, error rate < 5%, etc.]

### Planning - Inbound (SSOe is live for users logging in on [eauth](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/) properties and then navigating to VA.gov):
- Desired date range: 5/4/20 - 5/8/20
- Desired number of unique users: We plan to start with 1% of users and gradually increase users over two days.
- How you'll make the product available in production while limiting the # of users who can find/access it: Sticky feature flagging
