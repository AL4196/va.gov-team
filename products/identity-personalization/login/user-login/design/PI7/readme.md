#### Where we're at

Just finished a round of testing of the revised screens for the connect account, 2FA, and identity verification (KBA) flows. Research proved our hypothesis, so we're moving forward with making similar changes to the drivers license and passport flows.

* [Prototype](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/d/main/#/projects/prototypes/14460597) used to test the revised KBA flow
* [Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Products/Identity/Login/User%20Login/research/PI7) (session notes, synthesis, readout) related to that testing
* [Sketch file for that round of testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Login/User%20Login/design/PI7/flows-round-1.sketch)
