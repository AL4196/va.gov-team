# Conversation Guide for Profile 2.0 

## Intro

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Tressa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the profile on the VA website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 - 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we will be looking at a prototype.** This means that we are looking at something that looks like a real website, but it functions a bit differently. For example, some links will work while other links won't.   At some points we will be using the mobile version of the website for this study - so just use your mouse like you'd use your finger on a phone. This is for the purpose of testing so we can focus on observing specific tasks. Do you have any questions about this or what a prototype is? 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"** 

## Warm-up Questions

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Tell me about your service history OR tell me about yourself
2. Have you ever been to VA.gov?
- (if yes) How often do you use VA.gov on average?
-  What do you typically do on Va.gov?
3. Have you ever used VA.gov to update your personal information?
- (if yes) Can you tell me about this experience?
4. Have you connected any outside apps to your VA health records?

## Screenshare
I'm going to send you a link to a clickable prototype. Just a reminder - this is not a real website, so not all of the links work.  In the prototype we've used a fake name and made up information for this fictional person.  For the sake of the study, could you please pretend to be the person represented in the prototype?

Once you have it pulled up, will you share you screen with me? I will be asking you to complete a few tasks. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions. Information shown will not reflect any of your actual information.  

Alright, now I am going to share keyboard and mouse controls and we are going to walk through the prototype.

(*Intro screen*) First, I just want to reiterate that this is a prototype... OK, when you're ready, please click "Go to the Prototype."

We are starting from the VA.gov homepage.

## First Task: Wayfinding and profile navigation (Mobile View)

**Scenario**
1. You have recently moved and you've come to the VA website because you need to update your mailing address. Show me what you would do to change your mailing address. 
2. (*On the Edit form*) Since this is a prototype, we are going to simulate typing in a new address by having you click into any of the fields in this form. That will update the whole address. (*On the updated form*) OK, now you have entered a new address.
3. Great, could you show me how you'd edit the email address you use to log into VA.gov?

Alright, I have a few follow-up questions for you:

1. What could be improved about the process we just looked at?
- Do you have any questions about the process we just looked at?
2. What did you find to be clear and easy to understand?
3. What are your thoughts on how your personal information is displayed?

### Things to watch for:

- I noticed you clicked [this]. Talk about why you chose this.
- How does the participant interact with the nametag area of the page? Do they skip over it?
- How does the participant navigate to the contact information page?
- How does the participant navigate to the military information page?
- Make note of how user interacts with navigation.  Is it easy to use and to find?
- Do they understand why they can't edit all parts of the page?

## Second Task: Connected Apps (Mobile View)

Alright, now we are going to walk through another scenario.  Imagine that last month, you used your iPhone's Health app to share your VA medical records with an outside doctor. But now you've decided you want to remove the Health app's access to your VA records.   

1. Could you walk me through how you would do that?
(*Removes app*)
2. How would you connect a different outside app to your VA health records?

Alright, I have a few follow-up questions for you:

1. What could be improved about the process we just looked at?
- Do you have any questions about the process we just looked at?
2. What did you find to be clear and easy to understand?
3. What did you expect to see in the 'connected apps' section?

### Things to watch for:

- Do they understand where to go for 'Connected apps'?
- Do they understand that they cannot connect a new app through VA.gov?

## Third Task: Wayfinding and profile navigation (Desktop)

Okay, I'm now going to send you another link for a new prototype.  This will be the desktop version of Va.gov, and I'll have you walk through a scenario on this version.

(*From Homepage*)
1. Okay, so for this scenario you'd now like to see how secure your account is on VA.gov.  Could you double check that your two-factor authentication is on for this account?
2. From here, could you show me how you would see what bank account you have connected to your direct deposit information?

Alright, I have a few follow-up questions for you:

1. What could be improved about the process we just looked at?
- Do you have any questions about the process we just looked at?
2. What did you find to be clear and easy to understand?
3. What are your overall impressions of the desktop profile?
4. What are your overall impressions of the desktop navigation?

### Things to watch for:

- Where does user go to get to Account Security?
- Does the term 'account security' make sense to the user?
- Does the overall navigation make sense?
- If user doesn't have an app - can they figure out where to add one? 

## Post-Task Interview 

OK, those are all the screens we are going to look at today.

1. Overall, how could we improve the different scenarios we looked at today?
2. What did you think was clear/what worked well?
3. Was anything confusing? Why?
3. Any questions do you have for me?

## Thank-You and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to send you a $50 thank-you check. This will be sent by (Brian/Shannon from) Perigean, the people that recruited you to talk to us today. They'll work with you to figure out the right place to send it.

Any questions before we sign off?

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
