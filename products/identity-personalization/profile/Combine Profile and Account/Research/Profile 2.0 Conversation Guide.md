# Conversation Guide for Profile 2.0 

## Intro

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Tressa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the new profile on the VA website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.
- Tell me about your service history OR tell me about yourself
- How often do you visit the VA website?
- Have you used the VA profile or account pages on the current site?
- Do you have any applications currently connected with your VA account?

## Screenshare
I'm going to send you a link to a clickable prototype. Once you have it pulled up, will you share you screen with me? I will be asking you to complete a few tasks. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions. Information shown will not reflect any of your actual information.

## First Task: Wayfinding and profile navigation

**Scenario**
- You have recently moved and you've come to the VA website because you need to update your mailing address. Show me what you would do to change your mailing address. 

- Walk me through what you think these sections mean.

### Things to watch for:

- I noticed you clicked [search info]. Talk about why you chose this.
- How does the participant navigate to the contact information page?
- Make note of how user interacts with navigation.
- Do they understand why they can't edit all parts of the page?

## Second Task: FAQ

- Show me how you'd edit the email address you use to log into VA.gov.  

- I noticed you clicked [search info]. Talk about why you chose this.
- What are your impressions of the overall layout?

### Things to watch for:

- How do they interact with the side navigation?
- Do they scroll past their 'nametag' at the top? 
- Do they get lost while trying to edit?
- Do they use any of the 'learn more' or FAQ sections?

## Third Task: Connect an account

Great! I'm going to give you another scenario:

- You have been using the AppleHealth Kit application (which is an outside app) and you'd like to disconnect it from your VA account. Show me how you would you do that?

### Things to watch for:

- Where user goes to look for connected accounts
- If user doesn't have an app - can they figure out where to add one? 

## Post-Task Interview 

- What sort of information do expect to see on the VA profile?
- What tasks would you expect to do on the profile page?
- Is there anything that you didn't see that you wish was on the VA profile?
- What are you favorite parts of the profile? Least favorite parts?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
