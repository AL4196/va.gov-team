## Research Goals 

The goal of this research is to understand user comprehension after combining current 'profile' and 'account' into one page as part of the personalization 2.0 effort. This includes:

- does the user feel like the design reflects them personally
- can the user find the information that they are looking for effectively
- how does the side navigation effect task efficiency
- how easily can the user change information within the profile

## Research Methodology 

We used Zoom to conduct remote moderated usability testing sessions to observe how participants use profile 2.0.  We primarily used mobile views in InVision.

### Who we talked to

- 5 Veterans
- Ages varied from 35-65 (exact data unknown)
- No participants had any connected apps

### Research Questions

- Can people find what they're looking for in the profile?
- Do users understand how to update their information??
- What information is important for them to see first?
- Do the terms we use on the profile make sense/mean anything to users?
- Has the side nav increased scanability of the new profile? Do people find what the need easily?
- Do saving/errors interactions feel intuitive?
- Do people understand why some info isn't editable, and how to update it?
- How does the overall nav effect visibility of the profile? Is it easy to find?
- How do people think the new profile compares to profile/account 1.0?
- Do people understand what connected accounts are? Do they want to see this section of the profile if they don't have connected accounts?
- Where would people go to change the email address they use to sign in?
- Does the mobile nav and placement make sense? 
- Do users understand the 'learn more' sections? Are they actually representing the most 'frequently asked questions'?
- Can people find what they're looking for in the profile?
- Does the labeling on the left nav make sense?

## Key Findings
1. Participants preferred the new profile design to the old design.
2. Users expect to see their benefit information on their profile.
3. Users were unsure what email address was represented in the Personal and Contact Information section (contact vs log-in).
4. Users liked the 'name-tag' area, but it's taking up too much space in the mobile view.
5. Participants had a difficult time finding the 'profile menu', and in general were initially confused about the mobile navigation.
