**What if my military information doesn’t look right?**

Some Veterans have reported seeing military service information in their VA.gov profiles that doesn’t seem right.  When this happens, it’s because there’s an error in the information we’re pulling into VA.gov from the Defence Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).

If the military service information in your profile doesn’t look right, please call the Defence Manpower Data Center (DMDC).  They’ll work with you to update your information in DEERS.

To reach the DMDC, call 800-538-9552, Monday through Friday (except federal holidays), 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET.  If you have hearing loss, call TTY: 866-363-2883.
