## User Story: 

As a person who lives on an overseas military base, I should not be able to list any other country besides the United States in my address in the VA.gov profile or on any VA benefit applications.

## Background:  

The authenticated experience team has been working on an update to the user profile that will allow for better error handling of overseas military base addresses ([details here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/4386#issuecomment-568466453)). This is the TL;DR: currently, all address forms on VA.gov allow people to enter a country other than the United States if a person lives on an overseas military base even though US military bases are technically considered to be in the United States no matter where they are on the map. The updates we are making to the profile will allow a person to indicate they live on an overseas military base, and it will also prevent a person who lives on an overseas military base from selecting a country other than the United States.

Our team recommends that similar updates be made to the address forms in each of the benefit applications. However, these application updates do not need to happen immediately, and the profile updates we made are not dependent on the benefit applications also being updated. Updates to the benefit applications can happen any time and can be triaged accordingly depending on the priority of other work.
