# Release plan for address validation

---

## Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

- **We had not planned to do UAT for this feature**. Let me know if UAT is a requirement for launch. If so, we can launch behind a feature flag and do UAT.
- Potential launch date: Between Feb 26 – March 10 (Sprint 16 for the authenticated experience team).

## Phase II: unmoderated production testing

### Planning:
- Desired date range: Post-launch; some time in Sprint 16 (Feb 26 – March 10) or 17 (March 11 – March 24)
- Desired number of unique users: ~4-5,000 address form submissions in a week (likely a fraction of this will see the address validation flow)
- How you'll make the product available in production while limiting the # of users who can find/access it: We had not talked about doing a phased launch for this feature since it's pretty small, but we can do this if it is recommended by the platform team.
- "Success" criteria (by the numbers): Users who see the address validation flow are successfully able to override or use a suggested address. 99% of users who go through address validation are able to complete the flow.

### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Actual results (per your "success criteria")
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

More phases? Sure! If it makes sense for your product! Plan them out with the same structure as above.
