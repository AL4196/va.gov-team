### Samara: did you see KPI metrics populating from UAT?


**OK to proceed?**: N/A

- Per our [approved release plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/change-address/address-validation/release-plan.md), we did not do UAT. For launch, we will be launching this feature behind a feature flag and then confirming everything works ourselves. Only when we're sure everything is working as expected will we lift hte flag and release the feature to 25% of users.
