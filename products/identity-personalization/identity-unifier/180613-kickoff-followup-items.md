Next steps:

* Move forward getting access to existing VADIR services (GZ)
* Secondarily, explore the possibility of having VADIR team build a fuzzy match (GZ)
* Conversation with MVI to determine:
  * Do they have some existing connections to VADIR and/or BIRLS
  * How do we know if people in MVI are Veterans? Only from correlation IDs?
  * Why hasn’t MVI yet been enhanced to include records from other systems?
* Conversation with AAFES to determine:
  * What their NPRC data looks like
  * If we can access it through them
* Conversation with eMIS to determine:
  * If they can secretly talk directly to VADIR w/demographics
* Conversation with BIRLS to determine:
  * What Veterans they have that other sources don’t
  * How we can access their system
