**Goal:** A single authoritative Veteran identity source, either by aggregating systems or improving existing system/s.


The below summary is outdated... will be updated.

**Short Term:** Create an Identity Unifier API Checking VADIR & MVI
Use existing deterministic services to do a person check in VADIR; or use some secret MVI-VADIR connection if it exists. Use this to create a unified MVI-VADIR API, which would be used by SQUARES and vets.gov, as well as potentially other customers.

**Short/Medium Term:** Improve That Basic API With More Sources
Potentially also incorporate: BIRLS, NPRC, Corp â€“ if feasible, and if they actually have a significant value add.
Could also add a fuzzy(er) search in VADIR, either by the VADIR team building it, or by replicating VADIR and building it ourselves.
These could be short or medium term actions depending on what already exists and how much value we would be adding.

**Medium/Long Term:** Improve MVI
Especially given the Vet360 roadmap, the best long-term term option is to get MVI to actually include all individuals, and actually be a master index; but we may revisit this given what we learn from MVI.
