# Logged-in homepage Previous Research Review

**Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA), VSA, Authenticated Experience**

Liz Lantz (liz@adhocteam.us), 04/22/2020

## Summary

As part of discovery for a new logged-in homepage, we reviewed previous research to establish a foundation for the designer(s) tackling the logged-in homepage redesign, and to guide future user interviews so they are unique and answer new questions.

The majority of these research studies were interviews and task-based usability studies, and covered

- Evaluating homepage designs and task completion for the VA.gov redesign (2018), 
- Better understanding what Veterans expect from notifications, and
- Evaluation of the My VA MVP

We also looked at artifacts specific to the benefit experience, including journey maps and a comprehensive study completed by Frog in 2016 that goes into great detail about Veteran pain points from learning about benefits to managing info on line.

## Highlights

- Veterans are task-oriented and expect an experience tailored to them.
- The My VA dashboard isn't used much and is duplicative of the homepage. However, in interviews, Veterans found it helpful and easy to understand.  Generally, they understood the content, features, and functionality as it exists currently.
- Veterans would benefit from a centralized place online to see statuses and notifications, especially with regard to updates about applications and appointments.
- We need an onboarding experience for first time users of the VA, and for those who onboarding to benefits for the first time.
- Organizing content by benefit type matches the Veteran's mental model. One study specifically recommended organizing a dashboard re-design by benefit type since the new "Manage your VA Health Care" section of the dashboard met participants' expectations.
