# Logged-in homepage Previous Research Review

**Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA), VSA, Authenticated Experience**

Liz Lantz (liz@adhocteam.us), 04/22/2020

## Background

As part of discovery for a new logged-in homepage, we reviewed previous research conducted between 2016-2019. The goal of this review is to establish a foundation for the designer(s) tackling the logged-in homepage redesign, and to guide future user interviews so they are unique and answer new questions.

## Studies Reviewed

### Personalization 2.0

**[Personalization 2.0 Discovery: Summary and Strategy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md)**

- **Goals:** Evaluate usefulness of My VA dashboard and relationship to the homepage, and better understand service member experience vs veteran experience and impacts to our work.
- **Findings**:
  - My VA dashboard isn't used much, and is duplicative of the homepage.  
  - The visual design of My VA isn't scaleable or scannable.  
  - VA.gov users expect an experience tailored to them, and are task-oriented.
  - We need an onboarding experience.

**[Dashboard 2.0 User Interviews Research Summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization 2.0/discovery-research/dashboard-interviews/research-summary.md)**

This research rolled up into the larger Personalization 2.0 report linked above and reported similar findings to what is described above.

### Notifications

**[Notification research (March 2018)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Notifications/HCA MVP/Research/User Notifications Readout - end of sprint demo.pptx)**

- **Goals**: Gain insights into users expectations around notifications from VA.gov.
- **Findings**:

- **Findings**:
  - Benefit categories were easily understood.
  - Veterans responded positively to the simplicity and layout of the homepage, and the homepage exposed Veterans to benefits they may not have considered.
  - Tasks not listed in the "top 4" boxes were much more difficult to complete.

[**Preview.va.gov - Authenticated Users**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/VA.gov Relaunch 2018/user-research/study-8/Brand Consolidation Research Summary 10-25-2018_Study 8 only.pptx ) (October 2018)

- **Goals:** Understand how authenticated users work through top tasks on preview.va.gov.
- **Findings:**
  - Key login tasks worked such as signing in and out, completing MHV and eBN tasks from homepage, and seeing dashboard data.
  - Veterans had a hard time finding My VA and MY Health in top right of the page.
  - Deep links into eBenefits were not useful.

### My VA Research

**[Original pre-launch usability testing (April 2018)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/research/April 2018 usability/Personalization MVP readout.pptx)** 

- **Goals**: Examine functionality, nomenclature, navigation, and overall impressions in the Dashboard, Profile, and Accounting settings MVP.
- **Findings:**
  - Dashboard was helpful and easy for users to understand. 
  - Generally, users demonstrated understanding of the content, features, and functionality they were presented with.
  - Participants expressed interest in notifications, and changing the order of modules on the dashboard to reflect their personal preferences and activity.
  - Participants relied on links in the dashboard to get to settings instead of using main nav.

**["Find VA Benefits" user testing (September 2018)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Recommendations/Research/MVP Research/User Testing/Research Summary.md)**

- **Goals:** Evaluate Find VA Benefits tool MVP to better understand the flow, utility, and interactions.
- **Findings**:
  - Overall, participants found the Find VA Benefits tool to be helpful.
  - Participants wanted to see each block in the open state, and generally did not like being forced to manually open each module.
  - Study identified a need to more closely integrate the Find VA Benefits and Continue Applications tools in a V2 of the dashboard.

**[Health care application/My VA dashboard research (April 2019)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/user-testing/dashboard-updates/research-summary.md)**

- **Findings:**
  - People found the **Update** and **Decision** blocks to be helpful, but had mixed feelings about being able to remove them. 
  - People want to see meaningful next steps in their notifications
  - We should consider organizing the dashboard by benefit type; the new "Manage your VA Health Care" section of the dashboard met participants' expectations. 

## Journey maps

**[Veteran Journey Map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran Journey Map.pdf)** 

This provides an overview of the 10 life stages any Veteran may encounter.  This is a good resource to build an understanding of how Veteran's needs change over time, and inspire thinking around how our design can adapt to support them through those changes.

**[VA patient experience map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veterans Outpatient Journey Map.pdf)** 

This resource traces the outpatient experience from the perspective of the employee, and provides insights into painpoints Veterans experience related to receiving care from their provider. 

**Benefit specific journey maps**

Each of the following journey maps go into detail about a specific benefit journey. Journeys begin from application to receipt of benefits, focusing on actions needed and veterans' positive, negative, and neutral feelings. We should use these resources to familiarize ourselves with the processes for each of these benefits and inform how we might highlight them on the new logged-in homepage.

**[Disabilities claim process map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran Journey - Disability Claim - 11x17 -  9.4.17.pdf)** 

**[Education benefits map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Edu Journey Map_110518_v6.pdf)** 

**[Pension journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Pension Journey Map_011119_V5.pdf)**

## Research done by outside groups

**[Benefit planning, applications, and claims research conducted by Frog in 2016](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/4446518/D5_frog_VCRD_ResearchReadout_final.pdf)** (see slides 31-97)

This comprehensive research study goes into great detail around the overall benefit journey, from transition to managing information online.  While we've made improvements since then, there is a lot here that is still relevant to our work on a logged-in homepage update.  Recommendations that are still particularly relevant:

- Serve up benefits information that is personal and relevant to the Veteran based on what is known about each individual.
- Enable Veterans to get snapshot views and take common actions quickly.
- Aggregate personal information and documents in one location.
