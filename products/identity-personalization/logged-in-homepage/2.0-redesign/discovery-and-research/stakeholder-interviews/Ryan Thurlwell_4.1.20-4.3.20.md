# Stakeholder interview with Ryan Thurlwell 

## Interview 1 - 4.1.20 

### Tell me about your role and what you do in your work on va.gov

I am one of the oddballs on our DEPO team that has no very-strict role. I’m a designer. In the USDS directive is to “go where the work is” and fix things we think are problematic, so what that empowers us to do is have freedom and hop on to a lot of things. There are other folks that have taken on specific work, where Martha and I have always been “design spackle” where there has been need on a team for a thing, so we scrub in and do that.

There are kind of two main funnels for how work exists at the VA — the one funnel is the VA business needs. They come to us with a solution, and we usually say “let’s figure out what the actual problem is.” The other part of the work is work that we — DEPO — where we kind of… so VA.gov — maybe 2 years ago at this point — that was a different website, and one day everyone agreed (to make it a new website).

(Talking about how Ryan, Jen, Andy worked together) Together as a design team, would spin up a V001 — here is kind of a first draft that captures a vision so everyone can look at the same artifact and say “this is where we’re headed” and then iterate on that thing. So “Pittsburgh” spun up that way. It kind of just put everything in motion

### How were you involved with the vets.gov to va.gov transition, as it pertains to the logged in homepage/myVA experience?

Was not involved. Andy, Lauren, and Chris will be able to tell you a lot about that.

### What problems have you noticed about the current logged in homepage and myVA experiences?

The common mental model of a logged in experience are derived from banks, where if you go to a bank’s website it’s just a bunch of products. Which is what VA.gov is, it’s just a bunch of products. But if you go to your bank, you can get to a bunch of product things, like Bank of America which bought Merrill Lynch, so you can toggle between them (and different services). 

So that’s the ideal. You log into a thing and it’s a customized, tailored experience for you. I know from history from talking to Samara a while ago that the profile was basically just an unordered list. The VA is such a monolithic organization and everything is silo’d. Getting notifications to talk to each other (is hard) and everything is kind of hidden. 

The VA has room for improvement to change how the VA communicates. People should have confidence the VA knows who they are. It’s service design. (Ryan talked about how everything should be connected).

(Talked about VAMC experience and the “people in the red vests”) The signage was so clear, but they don’t use words th same way all the time. VAMCs used one term and VA.gov used another.

[Back to the homepage] So it’s a consistent experience, it’s branding, it’s integrated.

MHV — schedule an appointment, refill a prescription, download your medical records, and two others. So those 5 are the big tasks. Most veterans know MHV more than VA.gov.

VAOS is a good example — it was a tool you had to sign into separately. It’s taken us a year, but we’ve finally brought it onto VA.gov. And with all this integration stuff right now, you can go to Pittsburgh (the site) and you can hit “schedule an appointment” and you don’t have to go anywhere else.

[Back to the homepage] So for a signed in user, we know you’re enrolled in this and not enrolled in this.

### Can you show me some of your designs and talk about why you made some of those decisions?

[On designs he already did with Andy] Andy would have these epiphanies and just put stuff on a whiteboard and we would just start something.

[Shares screen/design] This was our first, bare bones, IDEO-style of what a logged in homepage would look like. We just bucketed… we just prioritized this… when you’re looking at the homepage, you can’t exclude the header. That’s a key piece of the logged in experience. I’ve always found our header (navigation) a bit kludgy (listed some concerns).

[On the actual page] We listed notifications. These should always point you to the product. So you would click (the notification) and go to see your appointments. 

And then we thought oh, instead of trying to section everything off (by benefit), you would just group like-material together.

Then, we took all the top tasks… and this is where I didn’t finish…. Are there notifications here too? This is the banking equivalent of having a checking or savings account.

And then we spilt everything else into “Manage”. So we have a health care bucket, and then we have everything else. So we have top 5 top tasks. This was probably the least thought out section. 

And then all of this is still accessible from a new menu (navigation) where everything gets rapped into these three buckets — Menu, Search, Locations — and then Sign In. For search, we could search right here (in line) and load results right here.

Then, I would imagine we’d have the VA locator tool and it would load your saved locations. 

And then I always envisioned the Sign-In menu to be the same thing. If you’re not logged in and you drill into something and sign in, the notifications would be here too (in the “Menu” area).

### How would you change your homepage design?

One thing this is doing which is tough to navigate at the VA. Here’s something I can tell you about Vets.gov to VA.gov, we took away their carousel and they were like “How are we going to tell veterans about a new thing?!” So we gave them (promo spots in other areas on the site). SO that’s not taken into account in (my mockups), so I can totally see the business being like “what about this” or “what about this?” I don’t know if the nav needs to change too much.

Also, I don’t know if you’ve seen (the blue sky prototype).

## Interview 2 - 4.3.2020

### Any additional thoughts since our last meeting?

I think we left off talking about service design.  All the touchpoints - that's where you lose the most trust. Talks about the need for consistency across branding, consistency, and touch points to establish trust. (Goes on to talk about variety of emails sent out by VA, lack of consistent branding, etc)

### How would an update to the logged in homepage experience impact your work?

It would impact my work in the sense that I would love to design it.  (Talked about how chaotic things are with so many teams, but feels things will get more organized as they move forward).  Our main goal is to enable folks like you [contractorImagines] to do the things that you do.  I would imagine the authenticated experience would come from DEPO as a collective. We'll figure that out as we go. 

### How about impacts to your work/involvement with the design system?

Instead of this being the last thing we think about how do we make this the first thing that we do? How do we make the components useful things that we can put out in the wild sooner so people can start using them and we can learn from them? (Talked about the alert/sign in widget that are part of the identity path) We need to standardize what that means to be signed in. What that looks like to be signed in on a tool page.  

One of Andy's ideas was "how does the healthcare hub change for me if I'm signed in" If you're enrolled we don't need to be asking you if you're eligible.

Something to always bear in mind for this work is that we’re constantly balancing what’s best for Veterans with the business which are not always aligned. Sometimes we have to throw the business a bone. Sometimes that’s what you see when you look at the pages, a compromise you had to make. You have to pick your battles and fight the one that matters.

Also think about the organic search results. How are people getting into VA.gov? Now, it’s [the site] has been there for a while, we know the top clicks, what can we infer from that data? The fact that everyone is going to the menu to drill down to what they want, says that they’re skipping all those tasks and know where they want to go.

This is only going to be effective if we re-work the IA. Andy, Jen and I have always talked about the benefit hubs as products, which they are not now. The profile page is a product too. You do specific things on that page that aren’t part of anything else.  The idea of a product page design, and that has two versions, auth and unauthenticated. 

### Would it be fair to say one of your goals for a new logged in experience would be changing the hub pages to a product page design, and the authenticated pages would have its own separate product design? 

It's overlap with that - there's a duality there. Sorry, this started with your question about the design system - getting all of the teams to start to work in a way where they're not dependent (on the design system) on what exists, but they can build something new. Sign in widget is a good example - hey now that we have all these alerts, this isn't serving it's purpose anymore.  We have no process in place to make that happen now though. (Talks about process shortcomings and finding ways to make design easier for designers, and challenges of collaborating on Slack)

Trying to find a way to spin up a logged in experience where - what does it look like in the nav, on a product page, on a tool? An idea Andy had that I thought was brilliant, if there's a notification about your appeals claim, when you click it, it shouldn't take you to your profile page, it should take you to the claims page, but what does that look like? What if you have several notifications about that? Or appointments, right? You've canceled and made several appoints, so you think of VAOS, what if you have several appointments at the top? This goes back to the product/tool page design.

### Do you have any specific goals for the logged in homepage, around functionality, changing user behavior, things you'd like to see on it?

Nothing beyond what we've already discussed. It seems like everyone has the same mental model of what it means to be logged in.

### What does success look like to you? How would you know this project has succeeded?

People are signing in automatically. Like my bank. I don't think I could even tell you what my bank looks like in an unauthenticated state.

### What metrics would you be interested in seeing around a logged in homepage?

It'd be interesting to see if logged in users started getting more adjacent benefits because we surface the contextual relevance, did you know there’s a home loan or you might qualify for this other thing, to see if those kinds of numbers go up because they don’t have to just discover them in the hub, it’s being surfaced for them. 

### What might make this project easier or harder in any specific ways, as it relates to your role on va.gov, or your team?

- It’s hard for me to let things go when I think I can design things better. I’m very opinionated and often wrong but often right.
- (Goes on to discuss challenges of folks working in silos and not seeing design work in progress once handed off to team)
- Being transparent. This is about our process and we need to find better ways to have design critique and review and talk about things
- There is also a design and technical debt issue. Something I’d like to see instilled in this process and part of everything, is that we need to some sprints dedicated to documentation, fixing old shit, and now that we’ve built it and it’s out in the world, what are we doing?

### What are concerns do you have about this project? What do you imagine going wrong?

Nothing I haven't mentioned already. I'll probably think about this and come up with something a week later.
