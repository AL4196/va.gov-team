# Logged-in Homepage Stakeholder Interviews Research Summary 

------DRAFT, 04/16/2020------

**Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA), VSA, Authenticated Experience**<br>

Liz Lantz (liz@adhocteam.us), 04/16/2020

## Research Goals 

As part of a larger discovery effort for the new logged-in homepage, we wanted to talk to DEPO stakeholders in order to:

- Gain insight to their goals and ideas around success for a new logged in homepage experience
- Understand the impact of this work to other teams
- Better understand risks
- Expand our thinking and gain insights into what we don't know yet

## Research Methodology 

We conducted remote 1:1 interviews  via Zoom between March 30 - April 17, 2020. A moderator began with introduction questions and prompted stakeholders with questions (from the conversation guide). Remote observers and note takers were also in attendance for some sessions.

### Who we talked to

- Charles Worthington
- Chris Johnston
- Lauren Alexanderson
- Samara Strauss
- Clarice Chan
- Steve Kovacs
- Andrea Schneider
- Matt Self
- Jen Lee
- Ryan Thurlwell
- Mel Woodard
- Kevin Hoffman
- John Hashimoto
- Mikki Northius
- Dave Conlon
- Andy Lewandowski

### Research Questions

- What problems have stakeholders noticed about the current logged-in homepage and myVA experience?
- How would an update to these parts of va.gov impact their work?
- What goals do stakeholders have for a new logged-in homepage experience?
- How do stakeholders define success? What metrics are they interested in seeing?
- What risks do stakeholders anticipate for this work? What concerns do they have?

## Key Findings

### Problems with the current UX 

1. The logged in homepage and navigation largely stay the same when people log in, which gives little sense of personalization and doesn't effectively present what we know about Veterans.
2. We're not effectively guiding Veterans to tasks and tools from the logged-in homepage or via the navigation.
3. Veterans are not receiving effective updates or communication through VA.gov

### Goals

1. A Veteran's logged-in homepage should be a data driven experience that reflects what we know about them
2. The logged-in homepage should guide Veterans in a meaningful way that helps them complete tasks
3. We should provide a logged-in experience that scales visually and across use cases

### Impacts to work

1. Teams can leverage the homepage to elevate tools
2. A new logged-in experience may influence how and what people build for Veterans outside the homepage

### Project Risks

1. Having many stakeholders could prevent us from delivering incremental improvements in a timely way.
2. The logged-in homepage could become a dumping ground.
3. We could create/increase Veteran mistrust through poor data integrity and login experiences
4. COVID-19 disruptions could impact ability to effectively interact with stakeholders

## Details of Findings

### Problems with the current UX 

1. **The logged in homepage and navigation largely stay the same when people log in, which gives little sense of personalization and doesn't effectively present what we know about Veterans.**

   Since the logged-in homepage and the majority of navigation don't change when you log in, we're falling short in giving Veteran's a personalized landing pad that makes them feel welcome, and missing an opportunity to provide them with a more targeted experience that reflects who they are.  Also, the content and actions presented to them are redundant across the logged-in and logged-out experiences, so the value of logging in is easily missed.  A Veteran can find personalized content in MyVA, but the [Personalization 2.0 research conducted in the summer of 2019](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research#observations-the-my-va-dashboard) taught us that users either don't know about it, or don't have much of a need for it.

## Additional Insights

### **Metrics**

It will be important to look at metrics before and after the launch of a new logged-in homepage to understand the impact we're having on Veterans (an in-depth look at current analytics to understand where we are today is planned as part of this discovery effort). Two common themes emerged when stakeholders were asked what metrics they'd be interested in seeing for this effort.

1. Measuring interactions can help us understand if we are guiding Veterans in a meaningful way that  helps them complete tasks.  Metrics to look at could be:
   - Navigation path from logged-in homepage, especially as it relates to online tools 
   - Interactions on logged-in homepage (what are users clicking on?)
   - Use of self-service tools
   - Volume of calls to call center related tasks available through the logged-in homepage
   - Volume of manual and in-person submissions related tasks available through the logged-in homepage

2. Measuring authenticated sessions will give insights into how Veterans perceive the value we're providing through a personalized, data-driven experience.  Metrics to look at could be:
   - User sentiment
   - Number of profiles
   - Time to log in
   - Number of authenticated sessions

### **Comparative experiences**

Conversations with stakeholders validated that banking and finance experiences closely match the use case for VA.gov - users can transact on the site, submit applications and receive a level of personalization that creates a strong differentiation in the logged-out to logged-in experience.  These experiences, when done well, also allows a user to easily understand their status/standing, and receive notifications. 

Companies mentioned that we'll aim to look at (account availability may create a blocker):

- Bank of America
- USAA
- Chase
- Fidelity Bank

Multiple stakeholders also named companies who offer personalized experiences that impact users both online and offline, or across multiple products such as Google, Delta, and Apple.  Insurance companies, such as State Farm or Geico also came up as something to consider, as they also provide users the ability to apply, file a claim, check status, and manage their benefits.

## Recommendations



## Next Steps

Continue with remaining research activities planned for this discovery effort.
