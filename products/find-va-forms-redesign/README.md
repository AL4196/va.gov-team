# Product outline: Redesign the Find a VA Form page https://www.va.gov/vaforms/

Search research indicates that the VA forms page consistently gets high organic search traffic. However it has almost no or very little conversion value. Because this page already gets high organic traffic and has high potential to provide better conversion:

- we want to redesign experience on this page to the new VA.gov look and feel.
- we want to create new content on this page to drive traffic to top tasks and to the top digital versions of form applications.
- we want to add analytics tracking to all links and downloads.

## Status/Decisions:

## __01/22/2020__

Summary from  follow up discussion with @kevwalsh @ncksllvn @kelsonic @Karak888 @mnorthuis and @jenniferlee-dsva   

Follow up to: How should/do we build the form detail landing pages in Drupal, if we use Drupal?

We determined that the static content on the form detail landing pages should be built in Drupal. This provides better access to update/edit static content as needed. The dynamic content will still be pulled via the API as REACT components. 

The standard helpful links can be created to use the same content links that's used on the search page (under the section "Manage your VA and...")

__Next step - Nick to investigate with API team implementation using ^ approach for the form detail landing pages.

__Notes from Mikki re IA, URLs, canonicals, and redirects__
Recap from to our discussion with Michael Bastos, @ncksllvn @kelsonic, @mnorthuis, and @jenniferlee-dsva on 1/14/20:

We will move forward with Option A above with some additional details.

__Option A__

The core search form URLs listed below will be permanently redirected (301) to the new URL: www.va.gov/find-forms/

https://www.va.gov/vaforms/
https://www.va.gov/vaforms/default.asp
https://www.va.gov/vaforms/search_action.asp
https://www.va.gov/vaforms/search_action.asp[all-parameter-variations]
To support the technical implementation/API work, a duplicate version https://www.va.gov/vaforms/search_action.asp will be created for the API to hit and collect data.

URL: www.va.gov/find-form-data
This new duplicate page must have a "noindex" tag and be excluded from the xml sitemap. /JL note: this duplicate page can be removed once the API can point directly to the forms database, per Michael./ 

The many child URLs that act as search landing pages for specific forms – i.e. https://www.va.gov/vaforms/form_detail.asp?FormNo=22-1990 - will not be impacted by this form search work. Each individual variation/URL will be redirected to a specific new URL. This will be mapped out as part of the form search landing page work.

Summary from  call with @kevwalsh @ncksllvn @kelsonic @Karak888 and @jenniferlee-dsva   

__Problem discussed: How should/do we build the form detail landing pages in Drupal, if we use Drupal?__

We walked through the form detail landing page content fields.  There are 2 kinds of form detail landing pages.

- 1/ Template basic landing page – dynamic. 

- 2/ Custom landing page – “additive” of the template basic version: a mix of the same dynamic fields, plus customized content. There are about 25- 30 of these custom landing pages for MVP. 

Kevin showed an example in the VAMC Pittsburgh site – how content is displayed in the CMS AX when there’s a mix of dynamic content from facilities API and other editable content fields. 

- This would be similar to how our custom landing pages could be built in the CMS for authoring and maintenance. 	
- Kevin’s initial informal assessment: low LOE for CMS team. (Unanswered Q: what’s the timeframe, would this be available for launching these landing pages in Q1?
- This option could be used for housing the template basic form landing pages as well (except nothing would be editable), and it would allow us to serve via CMS new basic pages with Mikki’s updated, modernized URLs. 

Nick brought up a potential option where everything, including customizable content, lives in GH/MD files. We didn’t discuss this option due to time.

__Next step: follow up conversation to investigate Nick’s suggestion, and to finalize decision on which approach to use.__
