__Notes from Mikki re IA, URLs, canonicals, and redirects__
Recap from to our discussion with Michael Bastos, @ncksllvn @kelsonic and @jenniferlee-dsva on 1/14/20:

We will move forward with Option A above with some additional details.

__Option A__

The core search form URLs listed below will be permanently redirected (301) to the new URL: www.va.gov/find-forms/

https://www.va.gov/vaforms/
https://www.va.gov/vaforms/default.asp
https://www.va.gov/vaforms/search_action.asp
https://www.va.gov/vaforms/search_action.asp[all-parameter-variations]
To support the technical implementation/API work, a duplicate version https://www.va.gov/vaforms/search_action.asp will be created for the API to hit and collect data.

URL: www.va.gov/find-form-data
This new duplicate page must have a "noindex" tag and be excluded from the xml sitemap. [JL note: this duplicate page can be removed once the API can point directly to the forms database, per Michael.] 
The many child URLs that act as search landing pages for specific forms â€“ i.e. https://www.va.gov/vaforms/form_detail.asp?FormNo=22-1990 - will not be impacted by this form search work. Each individual variation/URL will be redirected to a specific new URL. This will be mapped out as part of the form search landing page work.
