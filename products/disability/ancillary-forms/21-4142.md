# 21-4142 Private Medical Records Release


## Points of Contact
See [Teams](/Products/Disability#team).

## Keywords
Private medical records, disability compensation, 4142, 4142a

## Current Status
As [this summary](/Products/Disability/Disability%20526EZ/BAH-526/discovery/prior-research/forms#release-of-private-medical-records) states, the form is to authorize VA to get medical records from private medical facilities.

The private medical records release is currently in production as part of the 526 form.

The 4142 flow is triggered when a Veteran has indicated that they have private evidence. The user will be asked to either upload a copy of the paper form they've already filled out, or answer some questions in the application.

### What happens with the data
**TODO:** What happens to the 4142 data once it gets submitted? Does it get filled into a PDF and then sent somewhere? VBMS? What if they uploaded their own?

## How we got here
See [decisions](/Products/Disability/Disability%20526EZ/BAH-526/decisions.md) for 4142, [the 4142 integration folder](/Products/Disability/Disability%20526EZ/BAH-526/engineering/526-4142-integration), the [design](/Products/Disability/Disability%20526EZ/BAH-526/design/4142-4142a%20Medical%20Records), and [retro notes](/Products/Disability/Disability%20526EZ/BAH-526/4142_Retro_Notes.md).

## Errors
**TODO:** Where might errors occur? File upload is standard, as are validation errors, so I think this is mostly documenting back end errors.

## APIs
### `vets-api`
- `/v0/upload_supporting_evidence`
### `vets-api` calls
**TODO:** What are the endpoints `vets-api` calls?
