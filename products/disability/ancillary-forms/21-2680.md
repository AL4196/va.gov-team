## Keywords
Aid and attendance, disability compensation, 2680

## Current Status
The aid and attendance form is currently not a part of the 526 flow except that the front end provides a link to the form to download if the Veteran indicates their need for it on one of the 526 form pages.

## Future
We plan to incorporate the 2680 ancillary form into the 526 flow in the future.
