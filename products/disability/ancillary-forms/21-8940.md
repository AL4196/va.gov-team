# 21-8940 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability

## Points of Contact
See [Teams](Products/Disability/Disability%20526EZ#team).

## Keywords
Unemployability, disability compensation, 8940

## Current Status
The unemployability ancillary form 8940 is currently built, but not available in production.

The form is triggered by answering "yes" on the individual unemployability page. Once the ancillary form is entered, the Veteran has the option to upload a copy of the 21-8940 form that they've already filled out, or answer some questions to fill it out on VA.gov.

## History
See [decisions](/Products/Disability/Disability%20526EZ/BAH-526/decisions.md) for 8940.

### What happens with the data
**TODO:** What happens to the 8940 data once it gets submitted? Does it get filled into a PDF and then sent somewhere? VBMS? What if they uploaded their own?

## Errors
**TODO:** Where might errors occur? File upload is standard, as are validation errors, so I think this is mostly documenting back end errors.

## APIs
### `vets-api`
- `/v0/upload_supporting_evidence`
### `vets-api` calls
**TODO:** What are the endpoints `vets-api` calls?
