# Baseline EBenefits Usability Test

Findings for this project are in the [findings folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Products/Disability/Disability%20526EZ/research/september-2017/eBen-usability/findings)!

## Goal

1. Determine usability problem areas within the eBenefits user interface that occur while a Veteran is submitting a claim for disabilities related to their military service. 
Potential problem areas: 
   - Content: Does the content help the user understand what is needed from them during each step and what's next in the process? Is it clear how to locate and properly act upon information presented on the screens? Are labels clear? Is the language right?
   - Navigation: Does the screenflow make sense to the user given their mental model? Does completing a function require excessive keystrokes?
   - Control usage: Are the text fields and buttons used properly?
2. Better understand what Veterans previously told us they were thinking and feeling during their application experience by observing and listening to test participants go through the application themselves.
3. To provide a qualitative benchmark for the usability of the current application so that it can later be used to evaluate changes in the experience.

## Schedule

Starting Friday, September 15, ending on or about Tuesday, September 26.

## Methods

The usability test will take 45 to 60 minutes. Interviews will be conducted via go2meeting. 

## User Profiles

- Three to Five Veterans or Active Duty Servicemembers that have considered filing a disability compensation claim but never started an application. 
   - Time from separation should vary from just separated to 10+ years separated.

   - Vary in active duty service era -- Example: during the Vietnam War era (1964-75) and/or Post 9/11
- One to Two Veterans or Active Duty Servicemembers that have started a disability compensation claim (eBenefits or paper) but never completed their application.
