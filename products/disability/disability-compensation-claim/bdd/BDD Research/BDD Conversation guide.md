View the research plan.

Moderator logistics
Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
Before the session, send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).
In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute
Check your screen-sharing setup
When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro

Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian Valla] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about Benefit xxx
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
In this session, we want to hear honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. In reality, we're testing our online services, in order to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome all of your feedback. Both positive and negative feedback is very welcome.
During part of our session today, you'll be interacting with a prototype of a website. The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. But, don’t worry, I will guide you along. Of course none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.


Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)
Let’s spend a few minutes now, were I send you the prototype of the website we will look at today.
First, please minimize or close any windows that you don't want to share with us.
Now I'm going to share a link to the prototype in the zoom chat. Can you find the chat button in the Zoom app?
Great, can you click on it? There should be a link you can click on there.
Can you navigate back to the Zoom window and click the "Share" button in Zoom?


Warm-up Questions - (2 minutes)
Before we look at the prototype of the website, let’s start with a few general questions.
Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of prompts: Where do you live? Which branch of service are you in? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)

Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)
Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?
How did you file it (alone or with a VSO)? Mail or in an office?
Tell me about this process. 
How did you feel about the filing process from beginning to end?
Do you have any other comments about this process?

-Scenario: imagine that you are in active duty, and your release date will be 07/01/2020. Since this date is within 90-180 days from now, you might be eligible for the Benefits Disability at Discharge (BDD) program. This program allow active Service Members to apply for VA disability compensation prior to separation. The advantage of BDD is to get the compensation quicker when separating from service. 
-Imagine that you are not known in the VA system, and you come to this page in order to file a claim for a neck sprain. How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. Not all options are active in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary).
