## Research Goals 
To understand the current user experience, when going through a BDD process using paper forms and / or VSO.
How is the process perceived by Service Members, including: the workload, the timelines/deadlines, the complexity of the process, the pain points, the need for support/info?
To understand if the initial online BDD prototype works for users and matches their expectations and to test a BDD prototype for usability errors:


## Research Methodology 

A task-based remote, moderated usability study, March 18 - March 20, 2020. 
We interviewed 10 Service Members, all but one in active duty, via Zoom. 
The interview started with a few introductory questions (2-5 min), then a few questions about prior BDD experience / knowledge (if applicable. 0-10 min). 
Then the users were given a wayfinding task on VA.gov, to see how they would navigate to find info on BDD and where they 
would expect they should go to file a BDD claim online (if it was available online).  
Users was given a link to a BDD prototype and asked to use this to file a claim. They were prompted with questions and asked follow up questions as they moved through the BDD prototype flow. 
They were asked to talk out loud about their experience.
A note taker and several observers where present via Zoom. 


### Who we talked to

- 9 Service Members in active dutyn and 1 separated (from the military) veteran. 
- Geographically diverse (IN, NY, FL, PA, TN)
  - 3 rural
  - 2 urban
- Ages varied 25-64 years of age 

### Research questions

- How do users try to find BDD on VA.gov?
- How do users expect to get to the BDD flow?
- What usability issues and pain points exist in the BDD flow?
- Are there any confusing steps in the flow?
- Are the steps clearly defined or self-explanatory?
- Does the user organically move from step to step?
- Is there any confusing or ambiguous language that exists in the flow?
- Are users missing any information in order to feel confident moving forward?
- Are there other questions or concerns the user has while completing the BDD process?
- What do veterans think will happen after the BDD claim form is submitted?

## Key Findings

1. The expected number of search results varies based on geographic location.
2. The most likely use-case for the Facility Locator is when a person is traveling or researching an unfamiliar area.
3. Participants did not refer to the Facility Locator when seeking help for a specific issue.
4. The map is a secondary source for users to find a location.
5. Participants are more likely to look for VA Medical Centers than non-VA locations.

## Details of Findings

**1. The expected number of search results varies based on geographic location.** Overall, participants did not want to see more than 5 results per page. Rural participants wanted to see 2-3 results returned and mentioned that anything listed after that would be too far to travel. Urban participants expected to see a larger _total_ number of results returned, but mentioned that they would generally want to see around 5 locations listed. 

**2. Veterans and caregivers are most likely to use the Facility Locator when traveling or researching unfamiliar areas.** Each participant we spoke with mentioned that they had previously used the locator when they didn't know what services would be available to them in a new area. Most commonly, participants said they used it when preparing for a move to a new location. 

**3. Participants did not refer to the Facility Locator when seeking help for a specific issue.** When prompted to seek in-person help for a home loan, all participants looked in the VA Benefits and Health Care dropdown or the white boxes on the VA.gov homepage. Most participants wanted find a message center or a phone number to call before attempting to visit a location.

**4. The map is a secondary source for users to find a location.** All participants viewed the list of search results; observing the distanced, name of location, and address. We observed that they used the map to compare pins of locations. A few participants wanted to see an indicator of their current location on the map. Geographically, urban participants were more satisifed with the results listed on the map as the radius shown was smaller (15 mi. or less) than what rural participants were shown (varied, generally 15+ mi.)

**5. Participants are more likely to look for VA Medical Centers than non-VA locations.** Most participants expressed a general lack of trust when it comes to VA-adjacent locations and would often scroll past clinics and non-VA locations to find VAMCs or similar locations. If a participant had experience with the Mission Act and/or community care, they trusted non-VA locations more than those who had not heard of the Mission Act.


## Additional Insights

- Benefits help offices are often far away from a user's location.
- There is a need for Caregiver specific information
- Distance and travel time vary by location
- Users interpret facility descriptions differently
- Participants depend on the name of a facility to inform their search.
- Participants want to know what services are available at a facility.

## Recommendations
- Add “search this area” functionality to map
- Show 5 results on first page
- If user moves map, require them to re-search
- Add filter for “within x miles”
- Brainstorm new card labels
- Include a "you are here" (similar to google maps) on map
- Update labels to distinguish VAMCs
- Include information on regional offices for benefits help

## Next Steps

### Update search experience
- Implement design recommendations 

### Look into Veteran journeys
- Get a better understanding of how/when Veterans interact with and visit certain facilities and how they fit into the over Veteran Health Journey

### Prepare for accessibility testing
- Meet with Jennifer S. to plan
