## Research Goals 
- To understand the current user experience, when going through a BDD process using paper forms and / or VSO.
- How is the process perceived by Service Members, including: the workload, the timelines/deadlines, the complexity of the process, the pain points, the need for support/info?
- To understand if the initial online BDD prototype works for users and matches their expectations and to test a BDD prototype for usability errors:

## Research Methodology 
- A task-based remote, moderated usability study, March 18 - March 20, 2020. 
- We interviewed 10 Service Members, all but one in active duty, via Zoom. 
- The interview started with a few introductory questions (2-5 min), then a few questions about prior BDD experience / knowledge (if applicable. 0-10 min). 
- Then the users were given a wayfinding task on VA.gov, to see how they would navigate to find info on BDD and where they 
would expect they should go to file a BDD claim online (if it was available online).  
- Users was given a link to a BDD prototype and asked to use this to file a claim. They were prompted with questions and asked follow up questions as they moved through the BDD prototype flow. 
- They were asked to talk out loud about their experience.
- A note taker and several observers where present via Zoom. 

### Who we talked to
- 9 Service Members in active duty, and 1 veteran. 
- 8 Male and 2 Female
- Geographically diverse (CA, GA, MD, FL, VA)
- Ages varied between 25-44 years of age (exact age not recorded)
- Users ranged from very tech savvy (most of the users) to computer novice (1-2 users). 

### Research questions
1. Previous expeience with filing a BDD claim.
2. How do Service Members try to find info about BDD on VA.gov 
 - How do users expect to get to the BDD flow?
3. What usability issues and pain points exist in the BDD flow?
4. Are there any confusing steps in the flow?
 - Are the steps clearly defined or self-explanatory?
 - Does the user organically move from step to step?
5. Is there any confusing or ambiguous language that exists in the flow?
6. Are users missing any information in order to feel confident moving forward?
7. Are there other questions or concerns the user has while completing the BDD process?
8. What do veterans think will happen after the BDD claim form is submitted online?

## Key Findings

1. Four users have heard about the BDD program, and two had filed before through a VSO. One was a good experience, one was a bad experience. All users see great value in being able to file a BDD claim online.
2. Six of ten users did not find the relevant BDD info on VA.gov. Locating this info on VA.gov seemed arbitrary, and users felt that it was buried and too hard to find. 
All users eventually found the call-to-action button on the Content page, although several users felt it should be more prominent on the page.
3. Users have no problem with the Content page gating questions, however several are confused by a blue and a green sign in button on the BDD introduction page: “Do they do the same thing?”
Users have no problem going through the gating questions on the Content page. however on the BDD introduction page, they are confused by seeing a blue and a green Sign in button: “Do they do the same thing?”
4. 

Many users seemed hesitant and unsure where to go on the Content page ("How to file a VA disability claim") in order to start the claim process. All users found "Lets get started".button, but a few users think they might have navigated away from this page in a real-life situation. 



Six of ten users did not find the relevant BDD info on VA.gov. The users that did find it, did not feel confident that they would remember how to get back to this page. Locating the BDD information on VA.gov seemed arbitrary, and users felt that the info was buried and too hard to find. 


## Details of Findings

**1. Previous experience with filing a BDD claim**
 - Four users had heard about the BDD program and would use it if available. All users see value in being able to file a BDD claim online.
 - Two users had filed a BDD claim before. One user had a good experience with a VSO and filed a BDD claim successfully. The hardest part of the process was to figure out what paperwork he needed, and get info/updates about the process from VA. Lack of visibility and updates. 
 - One user had a bad experience. The VSO did not want to file the claim for him, as they had “too many returns” of BDD  applications. The user did not get the help he needed. 

 **2. How do users expect to get to, or try to find info about BDD on VA.gov?**
 - Six users did not find the BDD info page. The three users that did find it, did not seem confident that they would remember where to go the next time. 
 -  A couple of users used the search bar and searched for BDD and found the link "Pre-discharge claim", but the link was broken: (https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/when-to-file-claim/pre-discharge-claim/) 
 - A couple of users overlooked the link to Pre-discharge Claim because they were looking for other words/terms.
 - Users tried to find info about the BDD program under "Disability / File a claim for compensation", others looked under the main menu: "VA Benefits and Health Care / Disability / Eligibility". Others tried to look under "Service member Benefits" further down on the page. 
 - Overall, users thought it was too hard to find the relevant info on the BDD program on VA.gov. 
 - Two users suggested that the VA homepage should have a section or a button for Service Members that are about to separate:  “I am about to separate - what should I do now?” 
 
**Task 2: "Imagine that you’ve found the correct program and the correct form on VA.gov, and you now want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear). How would you go about doing this?"**
 - All but one user eventually find the call to action button, but several users think they would have clicked other places on the page if this was a real situation. A couple of users belived there was a chance that they would miss the "Let's get started" button. Several users would like this button to be more prominent.
 
**How do users expect to get to this flow / process?**
 - Users would expect to get here, either by using the search bar, or they would look for terms related to BDD in either the main menu (under Disabilities), on the tile called Disabilities, and a few would look other places on the page, e.g. under Service Member benefits. 
 -  Most users think they would use a VSO for this BDD process. 

**What usability issues and pain points exist in the BDD flow?**
 - On the gating page ("How to file a VA disability claim") some users seem hesitant, and not confident where to go, possibly due to: 1. The amount of info/text on the page. 2. The lack of terms corresponding with the BDD program.  
 - Users don't seem to find this initial (gating) process self-explanatory. A few users think they would have navigated away from this page by clicking in the left menu or on other links on the page.  
 - A couple of users think the text about supporting evidence requirements could overwhelm/scare some users away.  
 - A couple of users think the section “Can I file my claim online?” should be more prominent on the page.
 - When the users click on the gating questions, they have no problems going through the gating questions, but when they get to the BDD introduction page, they are confused by seeing a blue and a green Sign in button. “Do they do the same thing?”

**Are there any confusing steps, or confusing or ambiguous language in the flow?**
 - Several users find the page “Details about your condition” unnecessary in the flow. 
 - "New conditions": Several users prefers to add all their conditions on the same page, and then be asked about details for each.    
 - Several users want to see the info under the drop down link ("What if I don't know the name of my condition"), open on the page, as they find this info important.  

 **Are the steps clearly defined or self-explanatory?**
 - Several users think the option to upload Service treatment records is not necessary as VA will access these in all claim cases. 
 - Users found the BDD flow (after the gating questions) to be simple, straightforward, self-explanatory, relatively short and efficient.  
 - BDD intro page: When users click on the link ("Learn more about BDD"), they find this information helpful. They are fine with it opening in a new tab. 

**Does the user organically move from step to step?**
 - When the users came to the actual BDD flow, they went through it fast, with little or no problems or hesitations (one user went through the entire flow in approximately 5-6 minutes).
 - The users seemed less confident and more hesitant on the (gating) pages ("How to file a VA disability claim"). 

**Are users missing any information in order to feel confident moving forward?**
 - A couple of users are not comfortable uploading private medical records onto this web page. Security concerns. 
 - A few users would like to upload many documents at once (one click upload) (as they have many documents).
 - Several users think they should also get a text or email about receiving a phone call (and from what number) for a claim exam (one user said won’t answer any unknown numbers due to all the spam and phishing attempts going on.) 
 - A couple of users asked for a confirmation number or a claim number at the end of the flow. 
 - Several users would like an email confirmation after going through the BDD flow. 
 - Several users want a print button on the last (Submission) page. Users do appreciate the tracking option.

**Are there other questions or concerns the user has while completing the BDD process?**
 - A couple of users think it is premature to ask for Bank info, as they have no idea if they will get any benefits. A few users also have concerns about the Bank account security on the web page.
  - A few users think the questions about Additional benefits and additional aid are unnecessary at this stage of the process and suggest that they be optional.  
  - One uuser argue that many Service Members have so many documents that they will need help from a VSO. 

**What do veterans think will happen after the form is submitted?**
 - They think they will receive a phone call about next steps. 
 - Users would like an email confirmation about having received their claim. 
 - They would like to have some sort of time estimation. 
 - Participants do not think they will receive a lot of updates and visibility into the claim process. They think VA will only get in contact when they need info/records, and then get in touch again when claim is processed and their decision is made.
