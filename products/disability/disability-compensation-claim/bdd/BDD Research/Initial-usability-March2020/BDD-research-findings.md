**Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD)**<br>

Christian Valla (cvalla@governmentcio.com),  03/25/2020

View the [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/disability-compensation-claim/bdd/BDD%20Research/Initial-usability-March2020/BBD-Research-Plan.md).

## Research Goals 
- To understand the current user experience, when going through the current BDD process, using paper forms and a VSO.
- How is the current process perceived by Service Members, including: the workload, the timelines/deadlines, the complexity of the process, the pain points, the need for support/info?
- To learn more about where users would look for info about BDD on VA.gov. 
- To understand if the initial BDD prototype/mockup works for users and matches their expectations, and to test such an early BDD prototype for usability errors.

## Research Methodology 
- A task-based remote, moderated usability interview taking place March 18 - March 20, 2020. 
- We interviewed 10 Service Members, all but one in active duty, via Zoom. 
- The interview started with a few introductory questions (2-5 min), then some questions about prior BDD experience / knowledge ((when applicable.) 0-10 min). 
- The users were then given a wayfinding task on VA.gov, to see how they would navigate to find information on the BDD program.
- Finally users were given a link to a BDD prototype and asked to file an online BDD claim. They were prompted with questions and asked follow-up questions as they moved through the BDD prototype. 
- They were asked to talk out loud about their experience.
- At the end of the interview, the users were asked some exit questions about the experience with the BDD prototype overall. 
- A note taker and several observers where present (via Zoom). 

### Who we talked to
- 9 Service Members in active duty, and 1 veteran. 
- 8 Male and 2 Female.
- Geographically diverse (CA, GA, MD, FL, VA).
- Ages varied between 25-44 years of age (recruiter did not record exact ages. Age was missing for several participants).
- Users ranged from very tech savvy (most of the users) to computer novice (1-2 users). 

### Research questions
- What are their previous experience with filing a BDD claim?
- How and where do Service Members try to find info about BDD on VA.gov?
- What usability issues and pain points exist in the BDD prototype?
- Are there any confusing steps or ambiguous language in the BDD flow? 
- Are the steps self-explanatory, and does the user organically move from step to step?
- Are users missing any information in order to feel confident moving forward?
- Are there other questions or concerns the users have while going through the BDD process?
- What do veterans expect will happen after their BDD claim form is submitted online?

## Key Findings
1. Four users had heard about the BDD program. Two users had filed before, with the help of VSO. One good, and one bad experience. All users see a clear value in being able to file a BDD claim online.
2. Six of the ten users did not find the relevant BDD info on VA.gov. Locating this info on VA.gov seemed arbitrary, and users felt that the information was buried and too hard to find. 
3. Several users seemed unsure where to go on the Content page in order to start a claim. All users eventually found the call-to-action button, but several users felt that the button should be more prominent. Users are confused by seeing a blue and a green Sign-in button on the BDD introduction page: “Do they do the same thing?” Several users would prefer to add all their new conditions at the same time, and then be asked about details for each of these.  
4. Several users find the page “Details about your condition” unnecessary. A couple of users want to select & upload many documents at once (one-click) on the "Upload evidence" page.
5. A couple of users have security concerns about uploading private medical records. 
6. Several users would like an email confirmation after completing the form, and a print button on the last (Submission) page. 
7. Users expect to get an email about a VA claim exam, and some sort of time estimation. Several users expect few updates and a lack of visibility into the VA claim process.

## Details of Findings

**Previous experience with filing a BDD claim**
 - Four users had heard about the BDD program and all would use it if available. One users said: "My life would've been much different if I had" (... been able to file a BDD). All users see a clear value in being able to file a BDD claim online.
 - Two users had filed a BDD claim before. One user had a good experience with a VSO and filed a BDD claim successfully. The hardest part of the process for him, was a lack of visibility and updates. It was hard to figure out what paperwork he needed, and get enough info/updates about the process from VA. 
 - The other user had a bad experience using a VSO. The VSO did not want to file the claim for him, as they had “too many returns” of BDD applications. There was also a problem with location. One VSO told him he needed to file the BDD claim in the location where he was going to be after discharge. The user did not get the help he needed.  

 **Task 1: How do users try to find info about BDD on VA.gov?**
 - Six of ten users did not find any BDD info. The three users that did find it, did not seem confident that they would remember where to go next time to find it. Navigating to this information seemed to happen in an arbitrary fashion.  
 -  A couple of users used the search bar and searched for BDD and found the link "Pre-discharge claim", but the link was broken: (https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/when-to-file-claim/pre-discharge-claim/) 
 - A couple of users overlooked the link "Pre-discharge Claim" because they were looking for other words/terms.
 - Users also tried to find info about the BDD program under: "Disability / File a claim for compensation", others looked under the main menu: "VA Benefits and Health Care / Disability / Eligibility". And a few users looked for the info further down on the page, for example under "Service Member Benefits". Overall the BDD info is too hard to find. 
 
**Task 2: "Imagine that you’ve found the correct program and the correct form on VA.gov, and you now want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear). How would you go about doing this?"**
 - On the gating page ("How to file a VA disability claim") some users seem unsure about where to go, possibly due to: 1. The amount of info/text on the page. 2. The call-to-action button is below the fold. 3. The lack of terms on this Content page that correspond with the BDD program.  
  - All users eventually found the call-to-action button, but a few users think they would have navigated away from this page by clicking in the left menu or on other links, before looking below the fold, potentially missing the call-to-action button.

**What usability issues and pain points exist in the BDD flow?**
 - Several users would like the section "Can I file a claim online?" and the call-to-action button to be more prominent.
 - When users get to the BDD introduction page, they are confused by seeing a blue and a green Sign in button. “Do these two buttons do the same thing?”
  - Several users prefer to add all new conditions they want to claim on the same page, and then be asked about the details for each (this is also the format used in the "New Claims" flow).
  - A couple of users would like to be able to select and upload many documents at once (one-click upload).

**Are there any confusing steps, or ambiguous language in the flow?**
 - Several users find the page “Details about your condition” page completely unnecessary in the flow. 
 - Several users want to see the info under the drop down link: "What if I don't know the name of my condition", open on the page, as they find this information important, and they don't want to miss it.  
 - Several users think the option to upload Service treatment records is not necessary as VA will access these automatically in all claim cases. 
 
 **Are the steps clearly defined or self-explanatory, and does the user organically move from step to step?**
 - Users seem most hesitant when on the Content page ("How to file a VA disability claim"), and when the users find the gating questions, they have no problem going through these. 
 - Users found the BDD flow (after the gating questions) to be simple, straightforward, relatively short and efficient.  
 - When the users came to the actual BDD flow, they went through it fast, with little effort and confusion (one user went through the entire flow in approximately 5-6 minutes). The steps seem to be self-explanatory for the users. 

**Are users missing any information in order to feel confident moving forward?**
 - When users click on the link ("Learn more about BDD"), they find this information helpful. They are fine with it opening in a new tab. 
 - A couple of users have security concerns about uploading private medical records andBank account information onto this page.  
 - A couple of users asked for a confirmation number or a claim number at the end of the flow. 
 - Several users would like an email confirmation after going through the BDD flow. 
 - Several users want a print button on the last (Submission) page. Users do appreciate the tracking option.

**Are there other questions or concerns the user has while completing the BDD process?**
 - A couple of users think it is premature to ask for Bank info, as they have no idea if they will get any benefits. 
 - A few users think the questions about Additional benefits and additional aid are unnecessary at this stage of the process and suggest that they be optional.  
  - Several users think they should also get a text or email about receiving a phone call (and from what number) for a claim exam (one user said won’t answer any unknown numbers due to all the phishing attempts going on.) 

**What do veterans think will happen after the form is submitted?**
 - They think they will receive a phone call about having their claim exam. (They hope that they also receive a mail or a text about this).  
 - Users hope to get an email confirmation about VA having received their claim submission. 
 - Participants would like to see some sort of time estimation for their BDD claim. 
 - Users do not think they will receive a lot of updates and visibility into the claim process. They think VA will only get in contact when they need info/records, and then get in touch again, when the claim is processed and their decision is made. 

## Additional Insights
 - One users suggested that the VA homepage should have a fifth tile for Service Members that are about to separate: “I am about to separate - what should I do now?” 
 - One user believes that the text about supporting evidence requirements on the Content page could overwhelm/scare some users away.  
 - One user argue that many Service Members have so many documents that they will actually need help from a VSO in order to submit everything correctly. 
- The "Upload evidence" page might not be necessary: Service treatment records are automatically included, private medical records could be handled by VA, and lay man statements are not necessary.
 - Most users think they would use a VSO for a BDD process. 

## Recommendations
- Consider how to make info about the BDD program more discoverable on VA.gov.
- Fix the link "Pre-discharge claim" on VA.gov.
- Consider making the "Can I file a claim online?" section and call-to-action button more prominent. 
- Remove the green sign-in button on the top of the BDD introduction page. 
- Allow users to add all their new conditions at once.   
- Expose info in drop down: "What if I don't know the name of my condition" on the New conditions page.    
- Allow users to select and upload many documents with one click.
- Remove the pages “Details about your condition”.
- Consider adding a note about the security level regarding: uploading medical records and Bank account info. 
- Consider removing the Upload evidence page entirely.
- Remove questions about Additional benefits and additional aid, or make these an check box option. 
- Consider possibility for an email confirmation after completing the BDD form.
- Consider adding a print button on the last (Submission) page. 
- Consider providing users with an approximate time estimation for BDD claims in general.


## Next Steps
- We will make the recommended changes to the prototype (depending on the specific feedback from the stakeholders), code it into VA.gov staging area and do a second round of usability testing in mid-April 2020.
