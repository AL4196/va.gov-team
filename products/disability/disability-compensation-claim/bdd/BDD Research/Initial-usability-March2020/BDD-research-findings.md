View the [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/disability-compensation-claim/bdd/BDD%20Research/Initial-usability-March2020/BBD-Research-Plan.md).

## Research Goals 
- To understand the current user experience, when going through the current BDD process, using paper forms and a VSO.
- How is the current process perceived by Service Members, including: the workload, the timelines/deadlines, the complexity of the process, the pain points, the need for support/info?
- To learn more about where users would look for info about BDD on VA.gov. 
- To understand if the initial BDD prototype/mockup works for users and matches their expectations, and to test such an early BDD prototype for usability errors.

## Research Methodology 
- A task-based remote, moderated usability interview taking place March 18 - March 20, 2020. 
- We interviewed 10 Service Members, all but one in active duty, via Zoom. 
- The interview started with a few introductory questions (2-5 min), then some questions about prior BDD experience / knowledge ((when applicable.) 0-10 min). 
- The users were then given a wayfinding task on VA.gov, to see how they would navigate to find information on the BDD program.
- Finally users were given a link to a BDD prototype and asked to file an online BDD claim. They were prompted with questions and asked follow-up questions as they moved through the BDD prototype. 
- They were asked to talk out loud about their experience.
- At the end of the interview, the users were asked some exit questions about the experience with the BDD prototype overall. 
- A note taker and several observers where present (via Zoom). 

### Who we talked to
- 9 Service Members in active duty, and 1 veteran. 
- 8 Male and 2 Female.
- Geographically diverse (CA, GA, MD, FL, VA).
- Ages varied between 25-44 years of age (recruiter did not record exact ages. Age was missing for several participants).
- Users ranged from very tech savvy (most of the users) to computer novice (1-2 users). 

### Research questions
- What are their previous experience with filing a BDD claim?
- How and where do Service Members try to find info about BDD on VA.gov?
- What usability issues and pain points exist in the BDD prototype?
- Are there any confusing steps or ambiguous language in the BDD flow? 
- Are the steps self-explanatory, and does the user organically move from step to step?
- Are users missing any information in order to feel confident moving forward?
- Are there other questions or concerns the users have while going through the BDD process?
- What do veterans expect will happen after their BDD claim form is submitted online?

## Key Findings
1. All participants see a clear value in being able to file a BDD claim online.
2. Many participants had a hard time locating the BDD pages on VA.gov.
3. Overall, when participants start the BDD flow, they find it to be fast, simple and self-explanatory.
4. Several participants were unsure where to go on the Content page in order to start a claim. 
5. Some steps of the form flow itself caused confusion, including: 
 - The CTA buttons on the introduction page
 - Several participants would prefer to add all their new conditions at the same time, and then be asked about details for each of these.
 - Several participants found the pages “Details about your condition” unnecessary. 
 - A couple of participants want to select & upload many documents at once (one-click) on the "Upload evidence" page.
 - A couple of participants have security concerns about uploading private medical records.
 - Several participants think the option to upload Service treatment records is not necessary (as VA will access these automatically in claim cases).
 - Several participants would like an email confirmation after completing the form, and a print button on the last (Submission) page.
6. Several participants expect few updates and a lack of visibility into the VA claim process.


## Details of Findings

**1. All participants see a clear value in being able to file a BDD claim online.**
 - Participants think that they would prefer the online version of BDD for these two reasons: 1. The online BDD flow seems easier and faster than finding the necessary paper forms and filing the evidence in the mail. 2. It seems easier to track and find documents during the claim process.   

 **2. Many participants had a hard time locating the BDD pages on VA.gov**
 - Six of ten participants did not find any BDD info. The three that did find it, did not seem confident that they would remember where to go next time to find it. Navigating to this information seemed to happen more or less arbitrarily.
 - A couple of participants used the search bar and searched for BDD and found the link "Pre-discharge claim", but the link was broken: (https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/when-to-file-claim/pre-discharge-claim/)
 - A couple of participants overlooked the link "Pre-discharge Claim" because they were looking for other words/terms.
 - Participants tried to find info about the BDD program under: "Disability / File a claim for compensation", others looked under the main menu: "VA Benefits and Health Care / Disability / Eligibility". And a few users looked for the info further down on the page, for example under "Service Member Benefits". 
 - Overall the BDD info was too hard to find.

**3. Overall, when participants start the BDD flow, they find it to be fast, simple and self-explanatory.**
- The participants mostly went through the BDD flow fast, with little effort and confusion (one user went through the entire flow in approximately 5-6 minutes).
- The steps seemed to be easy to grasp for the participants.

**4. Several participants were unsure where to go on the Content page in order to start a claim.**
 - On the content page ("How to file a VA disability claim") some participants seem unsure about where to go, possibly due to: 1. The large amount of info/text on the page. 2. The call-to-action button is below the fold. 3. The lack of terms on the Content page that correspond with the BDD program.
 - All participants eventually found the call-to-action button, but Several users would like the section "Can I file a claim online?" with the call-to-action button, to be more prominent.
 - A few users think they might have navigated away from this page by clicking in the left menu or on other links, before looking below the fold, potentially missing the call-to-action button.
 - When the users find the gating questions, they have no problem going through these.
  
**5. Some steps of the form flow itself caused confusion, including:**
 a. The BDD introduction page has a blue Sign-in button inside an info box and a green Sign-in button right below this. This creates unnecessary hesitation/confusion in participants, as they are not sure if these two buttons will do the same thing or not.
 
 - b. Several participants would prefer to add all their new conditions at the same time, and then be asked about details for each of these. Participants think this will be more efficient and more logical (this is also the format used in the "New Claims" flow).  

 - c. Several participants found the pages “Details about your condition” unnecessary. For every new condition, in this prototype, we inform the participants that on the next few pages we will ask for “Details about your condition”. Participants find this step completely superfluous.

 - d. A couple of participants want to select & upload many documents at once (one-click) on the "Upload evidence" page. They argue that most Service Members have a lot of documents, making it very time consuming to upload one file at a time.

 - e. A couple of participants have some security concerns about uploading private medical records. A few participants are asking for information about the security level, such as a security certificate/emblem, regarding providing private medical records and Bank account information. 
 
 - f. Several participants think the option to upload Service treatment records is not necessary as VA will access these automatically in all claim cases. VA will always include the service records, private medical records can more efficiently be handled by VA, and layman statements are not necessary in most cases.

 -- g. Several participants would like an email confirmation after completing the form, so they know it went through correctly. Participants have experienced problems printing from within a web browser, so they want a print button on the last (Submission) page, to ensure all info is being printed out correctly. Participants do appreciate the tracking option on this page. Participants would like to see some sort of time estimation for their BDD claim.

**6. Several participants expect few updates and a lack of visibility into the VA claim process.**
Participants don't think there will be good visibility into their claim process. They think VA will only get in contact when they need info/records, and then get in touch again, when the claim is processed and their decision is made.
 


## Additional Insights
- One participant had filed a BDD claim successfully, using a VSO. The hardest part of the process was lack of visibility & updates. It was hard to figure out what paperwork he needed, and get enough info/updates about the process from VA.
- The other participants had a bad experience using a VSO. The VSO did not want to file the claim for him, as they had “too many returns” of BDD applications. 
- One participant suggested that the VA.gov homepage should have a fifth tile for Service Members that are about to separate: “I am about to separate - what should I do now?”
- One participant believes that the text about supporting evidence requirements on the Content page could overwhelm/scare some users away.
- A couple of users think it is premature to ask for Bank info, as they have no idea if they will get any benefits.
- A few users think the questions about Additional benefits and additional aid are unnecessary at this stage of the process and suggest that these be optional.
- Several users think they should also get a text or email (with the phone number) when they receive a phone call for a VA claim exam.
- When users click on the link ("Learn more about BDD"), they find this information helpful. They are fine with it opening in a new tab. 
- Several users want to see the info under the drop down link: "What if I don't know the name of my condition?" on the New conditions page expanded, as they find this information important, and they don't want to miss it.
- A couple of users asked for a claim number at the end of the flow.
- One user argues that most Service Members will have so many documents to file, that they will actually need help from a VSO in order to submit correctly.
- Several users think they would use a VSO for a BDD process.


## Recommendations
- Consider how to make info about the BDD program more discoverable on VA.gov.
- Fix the link "Pre-discharge claim" on VA.gov.
- Consider making the "Can I file a claim online?" section and call-to-action button more prominent. 
- Remove the green sign-in button on the top of the BDD introduction page. 
- Allow users to add all their new conditions at once.   
- Expose info in drop down: "What if I don't know the name of my condition" on the New conditions page.    
- Allow users to select and upload many documents simultanously with one click.
- Remove the pages “Details about your condition”.
- Consider adding a note about the security level regarding: uploading medical records and providing Bank account info. Consider moving Bank account info to end of flow and add a note about why its important to provide this info.
- Consider removing the Upload evidence page entirely.
- Remove questions about Additional benefits and additional aid, or make these an option to check. 
- Consider an automated email confirmation after completion of the BDD form.
- Consider adding a print button on the last (Submission) page. 
- Consider providing users with an approximate time estimation for BDD claims in general.


## Next Steps
- We will make the recommended changes to the prototype (depending on the specific feedback from the stakeholders), code it into VA.gov staging area and do a second round of usability testing in mid-April 2020.
