<h1 id="toc_0">Research Plan Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) (Usability test 1 of 2)</h1>

<p>VSA B&amp;M1 Team, BDD, Christian Valla, February 2020</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Background</h2>

<p>This is part 1 of 2 for the BDD research process. </p>

<p>-Part 1 will be an interview about previous BDD experiences + usability testing of an Invision prototype of the BDD flow. </p>

<p>-Part 2 will be a usability test of the finished BDD flow in Staging. </p>

<p>Service members (SM) who are separating and plan to file for disability can file their claim before separation. This is done through the Veterans Affairs (VA) Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program. This program allows Service members to apply for VA disability compensation benefits prior to separation. Claims must be filed between 180 to 90 days prior to separation. </p>

<p>Currently the BDD process is done through paper forms, by the SM and/or VSO. This requires a lot of management and processing time for VA. Transferring this process to a 100% online process will save VA time and resources and will also present a possibility to create a better user experience for the SM. </p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Goals</h2>

<p>To understand the current user experience, when going through a BDD process using paper forms and / or VSO.</p>

<p>How do Service Members (SM) experience this process? </p>

<p>How is the process perceived, including: the workload, the timelines/deadlines, the complexity of the process, the pain points, the need for support/info?</p>

<p>To understand if the initial online BDD prototype works for users and matches their expectations.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Method</h2>

<p>We will conduct a usability test with 8-10 active Service Members. </p>

<p>We will be conducting remote, moderated usability studies.</p>

<p>The first interview round will also include a 10-15 min section about their former BDD experiences.</p>

<p>We will use Zoom to conduct these sessions.</p>

<p>We will ask Veterans to navigate to an Invision link (provided in the Zoom chat) and share their screens with us via Zoom.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Participants and Recruitment</h2>

<p>We would like to interview 8-10 participants.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In order to get 8-10 participants, we would like Perigean to schedule 15 participants total, with the expectation that there will be a max of 7 no-shows.</p></li>
<li><p>For the participants Perigeon recruits:</p></li>
<li><p>All Participants must be active Service Members.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally 4 participants have started or submitted a BDD claim. </p></li>
<li><p>Ensure variation in age, gender, location, tech savviness.</p></li>
<li><p>Participants must be able to describe to the researcher what they are trying to accomplish, what they are experiencing and what they are thinking as they move through the prototype.</p></li>
<li><p>Must be able to use Zoom, use the chat function, share their screen through Zoom, and navigate an Invision prototype.</p></li>
</ul>

<li>What was the most confusing part of the process?</li>
<li>What is the workload and time commitment for the SM?</li>
<li>What were the pain points in the process? </li>
<li>What was the most helpful part of the process?</li>
<li>Did the SM have the info and documentation necessary? </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="toc_7">For the usability test of the BDD prototype</h4>

<ul>
