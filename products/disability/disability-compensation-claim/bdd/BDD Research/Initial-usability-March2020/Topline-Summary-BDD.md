[Session Notes]() Will be posted here shortly


This topline summary is a result of the synthesis that happens after conducting/observing research sessions. This is a high level summary of trends and analysis, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

## Research Questions & Answers

**Previous experience with filing a BDD claim**
 - Four users had heard about the BDD program and would use it if available. 
 - Two users had filed a BDD claim before. One user had a good experience with a VSO and filed a BDD claim successfully. The hardest part was to figure out what paperwork he needed, and get info/updates about the process from VA. Lack of visibility and updates. 
 - One user had a bad experience. The VSO did not want to file the claim for him, as they had “too many returns” of BDD  applications. The user did not get the help he needed. 
 
 **Task 1. ((Way finding task.) How do users try to find info about the BDD program on VA.gov?) "You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it".**
 - Most users did not find the BDD info page. The three users that did find it, did not seem confident that they would remember where to go the next time. 
 -  A couple of users used the search bar and searched for BDD and found the link "Pre-discharge claim", but the link was broken: (https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/when-to-file-claim/pre-discharge-claim/) 
 - A couple of users overlooked the link to Pre-discharge Claim because they were looking for other words/terms.
 - Users tried to find info about the BDD program under "Disability / File a claim for compensation", others looked under the main menu: "VA Benefits and Health Care / Disability / Eligibility". Others tried to look under "Service member Benefits" further down on the page. 
 - Overall, users thought it was too hard to find the relevant info on the BDD program on VA.gov. 
 - Two users suggested that the VA homepage should have a section or a button for Service Members that are about to separate:  “I am about to separate - what should I do now?” 
 
**Task 2: "Imagine that you’ve found the correct program and the correct form on VA.gov, and you now want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear). How would you go about doing this?"**
 - All but one user eventually find the call to action button, but several users think they would have clicked other places on the page if this was a real situation. A couple of users belived there was a chance that they would miss the "Let's get started" button. Several users would like this button to be more prominent.
 
**How do users expect to get to this flow / process?**
 - Users would expect to get here, either by using the search bar, or they would look for terms related to BDD in either the main menu (under Disabilities), on the tile called Disabilities, and a few would look other places on the page, e.g. under Service Member benefits. 
 -  Most users think they would use a VSO for this BDD process. 

**What usability issues and pain points exist in the BDD flow?**
 - On the gating page ("How to file a VA disability claim") some users seem hesitant, and not confident where to go, possibly due to: 1. The amount of info/text on the page. 2. The lack of terms corresponding with the BDD program.  
 - Users don't seem to find this initial (gating) process self-explanatory. A few users think they would have navigated away from this page by clicking in the left menu or on other links on the page.  
 - A couple of users think the text about supporting evidence requirements could overwhelm/scare some users away.  
 - Several users think the section “Can I file my claim online?” should be more prominent on the page.
 - When the users click on the gating questions, they have no problems going through the gating questions, but when they get to the BDD introduction page, they are confused by seeing a blue and a green Sign in button. “Do they do the same thing?”

**Are there any confusing steps, or confusing or ambiguous language in the flow?**
 - Several users find the page “Details about your condition” unnecessary in the flow. 
 - "New conditions": Several users prefers to add all their conditions on the same page, and then be asked about details for each.    
 - Several users want to see the info under the drop down link ("What if I don't know the name of my condition"), open on the page, as they find this info important.  

 **Are the steps clearly defined or self-explanatory?**
 - Several users think the option to upload Service treatment records is not necessary as VA will access these in all claim cases. 
 - Users found the BDD flow (after the gating questions) to be simple, straightforward, self-explanatory, relatively short and efficient.  
 - BDD intro page: When users click on the link ("Learn more about BDD"), they find this information helpful. They are fine with it opening in a new tab. 

**Does the user organically move from step to step?**
 - When the users came to the actual BDD flow, they went through it fast, with little or no problems or hesitations (one user went through the entire flow in approximately 5-6 minutes).
 - The users seemed less confident and more hesitant on the (gating) pages ("How to file a VA disability claim"). 

**Are users missing any information in order to feel confident moving forward?**
 - A couple of users are not comfortable uploading private medical records onto this web page. Security concerns. 
 - A few users would like to upload many documents at once (one click upload) (as they have many documents).
 - Several users think they should also get a text or email about receiving a phone call (and from what number) for a claim exam (one user said won’t answer any unknown numbers due to all the spam and phishing attempts going on.) 
 - A couple of users asked for a confirmation number or a claim number at the end of the flow. 
 - Several users would like an email confirmation after going through the BDD flow. 
 - Several users want a print button on the last (Submission) page. Users do appreciate the tracking option.

**Are there other questions or concerns the user has while completing the BDD process?**
 - A couple of users think it is premature to ask for Bank info, as they have no idea if they will get any benefits. A few users also have concerns about the Bank account security on the web page.
  - A few users think the questions about Additional benefits and additional aid are unnecessary at this stage of the process and suggest that they be optional.  
  - One uuser argue that many Service Members have so many documents that they will need help from a VSO. 

**What do veterans think will happen after the form is submitted?**
 - They think they will receive a phone call about next steps. 
 - Users would like an email confirmation about having received their claim. 
 - They would like to have some sort of time estimation. 
 - Participants do not think they will receive a lot of updates and visibility into the claim process. They think VA will only get in contact when they need info/records, and then get in touch again when claim is processed and their decision is made. 

**User suggestions:**
- Users suggested a chat function in the BDD flow, or a phone number to call, to get a qualified person in VA to help with the specific BDD flow. 
- A few users suggested adding a FAQ in the gating pages, on the BDD Info page or on the BDD introduction page.
- Users suggested to add, somewhere in the flow: "Average days to complete a BDD claim" 
- Consider adding: "Please allow 24 hours before chacking your claim status". 
- One user suggested to add a percentage complete on the progress bar, as each section varies a lot in number of steps / length.
