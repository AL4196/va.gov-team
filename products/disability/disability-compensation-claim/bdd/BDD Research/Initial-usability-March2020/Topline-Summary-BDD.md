[Session Notes]() 

Topline Summary is a short text in which we capture our first impressions from the research. It’s a summary of the main observations that the researcher and the observers have captured. This summary is all based on initial observations. At this point, the data has not been analysed. In the Topline we articulate some of the patterns we think are emerging, but these ideas may change once we do a detailed analysis and synthesis of the data we’ve gathered.

**The goals of the topline summary:**
 - For everyone who observed the BDD sessions to align on perceived top findings. 
 - Allow for the team to let the researchers/designers know if there are any specific directions they want us to pursue as we analyze and synthesize the data we’ve gathered.

## Top level summary of findings from the initial BDD Research

**Previous BDD experiences**
 - Four users had heard about BDD. Two users had filed a BDD claim. One was a good experience using a VSO. Successfully filed a claim. One was a bad experience using a VSO. Not getting the help he needed. Many rounds before finally being able to file.  

**Overall wayfinding tasks:**
- Most users did not find the BDD page and felt it should be much easier to find.

**Overall what did users think about the BDD flow?**
- Users were somewhat hesitant when using the gating pages, possibly overwhelmed by: 1. The amount of text and info on the page. 2. The lack of terms corresponding with the BDD program. 
- Several users felt that the call to action button should be more prominent. 
- When the users started the gating questions, the flow seemed pretty self-explanatory, except some confusion about the blue and the green Sign in button on the BDD info page. 
- When users came to the actual BDD flow, they went through it fast, with little or no problems or hesitations (one user went through the flow in approximately 5-6 minutes).
- Users found the flow to be simple, straightforward, self explanatory, relatively short and efficient. 

## Findings

**Short interview about previous experiences with filing for BDD**
 - Four users had heard about BDD and would use it if available. 
 - Two users had filed a BDD claim. One user had a good experience with a helpful VSO and filed a BDD claim successfully. Hardest part: figure out what paperwork he needed, and get info / updates about the process from VA. Lack of visibility and updates. 
 - One user had a bad experience. The VSO did not want to file the claim for him, as they had “too many returns” of BDD  applications. He did not get the help he needed. 
 
**Way finding task: You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it.**
 - Most users did not find the BDD info page. The three users that did find it, did not seem confident that they would remember where to go the next time. 
 -  A couple of users searched for BDD and found the link ("Pre-discharge claim"), but the link was broken: (https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/when-to-file-claim/pre-discharge-claim/) 
 - A couple of users overlooked the link to Pre-discharge Claim, as they were looking for other words / terms.
 - Users tried to find info about the BDD program under "Disability / File a claim for compensation", others looked under the main menu: "VA Benefits and Health Care / Disability / Eligibility". Others tried to look under "Service member Benefits" further down on the page. Overall, the page that describes the BDD program is too hard to find on VA.gov. 
 - Two users suggest that the VA homepage should have a section or a button for Service Members that are about to separate:  “I am about to separate - what should I do now?” 

**Task 2: Imagine that you’ve found the correct program and the correct form on VA.gov, and you now want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus. How would you go about doing this?**

**Gating questions**
- Gating pages: Users seem somewhat hesitant and not very confident as they interact with the first gating pages ("How to file a VA disability claim"). They seem a bit overwhelmed by all the text and some are confused to not see any text about BDD specifically. A couple of users think the supporting evidence requirements will overwhelm / scare some users away.  Several users think the section “Can I file my claim online?” should be more prominent on the page. When users start the gating questions, they seem more confident and less hesitant. 
 - BDD intro page: When users click on the link ("Learn more about BDD"), they find this information helpful. They are fine with it opening in a new tab. 
 - BDD intro page (not signed in): some users are confused by the blue and green sign in button. “Do they do the same thing?” 
 
 **Service member info**
 - Users seem confident and move quickly when they get to the BDD flow itself. Users find the Personal info page as well as the Contact info page and the Different name page easy and self-explanatory. 
 - The same goes for the Bank account page. A couple of users think it is premature to ask for Bank info, as they have no idea if they will get any benefits. A few users also have concerns about account security.
 
**Military history**
- The questions about Military history seems self-explanatory for the users. 

**New conditions**
 - Several users want to add all of their conditions on the same page, and then be asked questions about each of them. Several users want to see the info under the drop down link (What if I don't know the name of my condition), open on the page, as they find the info important. 
 - Several users find the page “Detail about your condition” unnecessary in the flow. 
 - The remaining questions under “New conditions” seem self-explanatory for the users. 

**Additional benefits and aid**
 - These questions seem to be self-explanatory, but a couple of users think these questions are unnecessary at this stage of the process and suggest that they be optional instead.  - No participants looked for a filter to refine their search further than the given dropdowns
 - Few participants looked past the first page of results shown 

**Supporting evidence**
 - A couple of users are not comfortable uploading private medical records here.
 - Several users think the Service treatment records is not necessary, as VA will access these in any claim cases.  
 
**Upload document page**
 - A couple of users argue that many Veterans will have so many documents that they would need help from a VSO. 
 - A couple of users would like to upload many documents at once (one click upload).
 - Several users wanted a chat help function or a call number for help with the BDD flow. 
  
**Supporting evidence (phone call about claim exam)**
 - Several users think they should also get a text or email about receiving a phone call for a claim exam. (Several users say they won’t answer unknown numbers due to all the spam and phishing attempts going on.) 

**Review application page**
 - This page seems to be familiar and self-explanatory for users.
 
 **Submission page**
 - This page seems to be self-explanatory for users. 
 - Several users would like an email confirmation. 
 - A couple of users asked for a confirmation number or a claim number. 
 - Several users want a print button on this page. 
 - Users appreciate the tracking option.  

**Other user suggestions:**
- Consider a chat function in the BDD flow, or a phone number to call to get help with the BDD flow. 
- Consider a FAQ in the gating page or BDD info page or the BDD introduction page.
- Consider adding somewhere in the flow: Average days to complete a BDD claim 
- Consider adding: Check the claim status after 24 hours. 
- One user suggested to add a percentage complete on the progress bar, as each section varies a lot in number of steps / length.
