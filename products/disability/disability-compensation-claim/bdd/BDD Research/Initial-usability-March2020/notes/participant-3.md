DATE/TIME OF INTERVIEW: 3/18/20 at 2:00 PM EST

# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 1 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian Valla] and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the appeals process on VA.gov, specifically an appeals process that we call a Higher Level Review.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. In reality, we're testing our online services, in order to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Both positive and negative feedback is very welcome.

- During part of our session today, you'll be interacting with a prototype of a website. The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. But, dont worry, I will guide you along. Of course none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Start recording.

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

Before we look at the prototype of the website, let’s start with a few general questions.

Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of promts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)

P: Currently live in [state], active duty Army.



## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

C: Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?

P: No I have not but I did look into the paperwork because I was thinking about getting out instead of re-enlisting but I did re-enlist.

C: Got it.


## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)

You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.

**Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]**

P: I would probably go to 'file a claim for compensation'. 

C: Walk me through what you're thinking.

P: So I would probably click on 'find out if yu're eligible.' Then I would read through and then see if I am eligible.

C: So go back to the home page please, and if you were trying to find information on this program, where would you go to find that?

P: *(goes back to home page, then clicks to disability page)*

C: What words are you looking for?

P: I'm looking for words like 'active'...I honestly don't know where'd you go if you were active duty!

C: That's totally fine! We're just trying to find out how difficult it is to find this page.


## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

**How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)**

**INFO PAGE**

P: I would look to see if I could file a claim...(clicks let's get started button) then I would click this.


**INTRO PAGE**

P: Prepare, evidence....so then I would sign in to file BDD.

C: If anything is unclear, let me know.

P: Start a BBD claim... (clicks on it)


**SERVICE MEMBER INFO**

P: so I'd just make sure my info was accurate then hit continue.


**MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY**





**DISABILITIES**

C: So let me stop you here and let you know that it would basically just complete whatever you're typing in here.

P: Oh well that would be helpful.

C: You can go ahead and click on what if I don't know the name of my condition?


**NECK SPRAIN**

P: You'd just put in what happened, pretty self explanatory....

**TINNITUS**

**ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS**


**SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**

C: We can imagine here that you have private medical records.

P: Okay.

C: What would you expect to see if you clicked the dropdown here?

P: Maybe it would say pdf, or jpg, or something like a packet of folders or something like that.

C: What would you expect to see if you clicked on one of these (accordions)?

P: It would probably give me a number to call them if I hit 'what happens if I miss a phone call'. It tells you what you need and there's a warning sign that lets you know here and what vendors might contact you.

**REVIEW**

P: Obviously here to make sure the details are accurate. My info is correct, I'd read the privacy policy, and I'd check the box.....


**SUBMIT**

## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?

P: I think that this was really easy, very user friendly, I think it was great that it had where you can type out part of what your condition is, as some medical conditions are spelled oddly. It seemed really smooth from start to finish. It gives you confirmation that your request has been submitted.



C: If you had a magic wand and could change one thing about this process, what would it be?

P: I would say on the review part, maybe it should also show the supporting docs that you submitted, so you're aware that it did upload properly so they will get that. Even here it doesn't show confirmation that you uploaded it.



C: most frustrating or confusing part?

P: I didn't think anything was unclear, except if you didnt know what you could upload for supporing evidence. It would be nice if it laid it out pretty easy so you could figure it out. It doesn't give you a timeline but it's nice that it lets you know what happens after you file your claim. It would be nice if it had estimates/timelines.


C: What do you think was the most helpful part of this flow?

P: The fact htat you can type a word of your condition and have it complete to what it was you were looking for.

C: If you did do a BDD claim, would you do it this way?

P: Oh absolutely I would do it! 

Any other comments?

P: Maybe there could be a chat feature in case you did have a question during filing it. Maybe they could assist you with something simple.



*Christian goes through thank you and closing*
