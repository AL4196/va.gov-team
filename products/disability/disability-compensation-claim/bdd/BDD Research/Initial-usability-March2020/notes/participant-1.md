DATE/TIME OF INTERVIEW: 3/18/20 at 12:00 PM EST

# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 1 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian Valla] and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the appeals process on VA.gov, specifically an appeals process that we call a Higher Level Review.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. In reality, we're testing our online services, in order to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Both positive and negative feedback is very welcome.

- During part of our session today, you'll be interacting with a prototype of a website. The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. But, dont worry, I will guide you along. Of course none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Start recording.

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

Before we look at the prototype of the website, let’s start with a few general questions.

Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of promts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)

P: I live in [city], [state], was in the Army, retired end of December. And I've done interviews like this before, and this is the second time for the VA, yeah.

C: How was the last VA interview experience?

P: It was fine. Getting better! I'm just learning the system because I just retired.

C: Have you filed a BDD claim?

P: Yes, I am currently in the process. I just got my percentage 2-3 weeks ago.

C: How was the process?

P: The process initially with the claim was fairly easy...started making medical appointments through a 3rd party, not the VA...once they set appointments they don't like changing times, which was the only issue I had with that. I didn't go through the VA for the medical assessments, I went through Leidos which was pretty easy.

C: Did you file it alone?

P: I had a VSO do it, yeah.

C: How was that?

P: Oh that was fine. He helped me with the claims process.

C: What was the hardest part of this process?

P: Figuring out which paperwork I had to turn in, and having the VA tell me where the process was. It kind just sits in a queue until you actually retire, they don't give you a lot of information. They can't give you a determination until you are actually in retired status. I got emails, then asked 'what does this code mean?' And they didn't really know...but all of a sudden I get a package in the mail with their decision (laughs). 

C: How would you like it to have been different?

P: So I looked on the site and it says things but it doesn't make sense, and then you call in the VA and they don't really know the information. It's not just me, inside the org, it's, you know...

C: Do you remember what was most condusing?

P: Comms, what codes meant.

C: Anything that was particularly helpful?

P: It came through fairly quickly for a decision...end of December I think. It was tough trying to figure out compensation and how that works. 

C: If you did this process from the start again, would you do it differently?

P: No, not really no.

## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

- Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?
- How did you file it (alone or with a VSO)? Mail or in an office?
- Tell me about how it was to go through this process.
- What were the hardest parts?
- What was most confusing within this process?
- Was there anything in particular that was helpful in this process?
- If you would do it again, would you do anything different?
- Do you have any other comments about this process?


## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)

You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.

**Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]**

P: I would look for 'file for disability compensation' probably...

*user goes to 'HOW TO FILE A CLAIM' on VA.gov*

checks sidebar --> clicks when to file

P: I would check the 90 days...

C: So if you wanted to get more info on the BDD process, how would you do that?

P: I would probably click here...*(goes to pre-discharge claim)*

C: This is the page I was hoping you'd find. How was it finding this?

P: Not too bad, not too bad...

C: Anything that could improve this?

P: No...not anything major.


## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

**How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)**

P: So I'd click let's get started I guess...

C: let's imagine you're in active duty.

P: I would just click file...

*user clicked the file button*

C: So if this was a real situation do you think you'd read through this text?

P: If I was alone, without a VSO, I would probably just click and start.

**SERVICE MEMBER INFO**


**MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY**

**DISABILITIES**

C: so what if you're not sure on the name of your disability?

P: I'd click this 'what if I don't know the name of my condition?'

C: If you were in the real website it would prepopulate based on what you're typing.

P: Gotcha.

C: So does this make sense?

P: yup!

**NECK SPRAIN**

C: This is required to type in. What do you think about that?

P: Well that's what med records are for if it's a medical condition.

C: So do you think this should be reqiuired?

P: Optional. They're gonna verify records anyway so I'd make it optional.

**TINNITUS**

**ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS**

C: Anything unclear here?

P: No, nothing off hand.

**AUTO ALLOWANCE ADAPTIVE BENEFITS**

**AID AND ATTENDANCE**

**IND. UNEMPLOYABILITY**


**SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**

P: Would be nice to have more information here about rescheduling, that kinda stuff.

C: What would you expect to see if you click on 'what happens if I miss a phone call?'

P: That they're gonna stick you with an appointment you might not be able to make! (laughs)

C: What would you expect to see if you click on 'why do I need to do an exam?'


**REVIEW**

P: This is where you make sure everything is right...so this is the post-leaving military address?

C: Yeah so what address would make sense here?

P: Yeah just forwarding address post ETS - just make sure they understand what that means. Most people would, but...

SUBMIT

C: Do you have any comments about this page?

P: Does it give you a claim or status number?

C: So you would expect that?

P: Yeah something like that, yeah. Then once it's done, does it email you?

C: Would you expect to get that?

P: yeah, I think so.

C: So you would want a confirmation email? what would you expect to see in that?

P: Claim number, that kinda information. Nothing that would be PHI or PII or anything.


## Potential Followup questions

Before clicking on anything, explore this page and let me know what you think the main purpose of this page is.
Do you think this page accomplishes this purpose?
What is most confusing or unclear on this page?
What is most helpful on this page?
What could be added to this page to make it more useful or clear?


## Post-Task Interview

Overall what do you think about going through this process?

P: Not too bad, not too bad. Just a couple tweaks. Other than that, fairly easy.

[if they've gone through the BDD process on paper] 

What do you think of this process versus the paper process you've gone through?

P: I went through a VSO, this wasn't too bad but I would still go through a VSO to do this. Just good to have a second set of eyes.

C: So you'd still go through a VSO for this? How would that compare to paper form?

P: I don't mind doing things on computers. It's fine. Some might be leary of it.

C: If you had a magic wand and could change one thing about this process, what would it be?

P: Hmm...just making sure it comes back on email is kinda a big thing, claim number, maybe have it at the beginning. 

C: Most frustrating or confusing part?

P: just finding where it's at on the webpage. But nothing major I can say right now.

C: What do you think was the most helpful part of this flow?

P: The search functionality, for the conditions that the VA actually gives ratings for, was good.

Any other comments?

P: No, not bad, not bad.

*Christian goes through thank you and closing*
