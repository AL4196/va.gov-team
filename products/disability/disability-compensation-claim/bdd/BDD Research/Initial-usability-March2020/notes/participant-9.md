# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 1 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian Valla] and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the benefits process on VA.gov, specifically a benefits process that we call Benefits Delivery at Discharge.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. In reality, we're testing our online services, in order to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Both positive and negative feedback is very welcome.

- During part of our session today, you'll be interacting with a prototype of a website. The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. But, dont worry, I will guide you along. Of course none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Start recording.

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

Before we look at the prototype of the website, let’s start with a few general questions.

Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of promts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)

Navy, [city], [state]

## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

C: Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?


C: How did you file it (alone or with a VSO)? Mail or in an office?


C: Tell me about how it was to go through this process.


C: What were the hardest parts?


C: What was most confusing within this process?


C: Was there anything in particular that was helpful in this process?


C: If you would do it again, would you do anything different?


C: Do you have any other comments about this process?


## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)

You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.

**Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]**

P: (goes to disability page) --> (eligibility)

P: I would not know where to find disability rating.

(participant was unable to complete this task so Christian decided to move on)


## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

**How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)**

**INFO PAGE**

P: Firstly I'm going to find out if I'm eligible for it. (would click link). If it says I'm eligible then I'm going to file for it. And I would look for an email address or phone number to contact.

P: looks like I could click this (let's get started) (clicks it)


**INTRO PAGE**

P: I'm going to get confused because the previous page said to file a claim and this one says I'm doing a benefits delivery at discharge.


**SERVICE MEMBER INFO**




**MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY**



**DISABILITIES**

(participant stated they belived previous page was unnecessary - 'going to ask a few questions about this disability' page)


**NECK SPRAIN**

P: having a number or chat session I can call anytime - if I don't know what to put in. I would prefer to have a call feature. 


**TINNITUS**



**ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS**

- user states that the intro screen to this section is unnecessary

"If I was a veteran uploading my personal information I would at least ask for a DSLogon".

- user would want something to say it was encrpyted or safe


Summary of disabilities - user states that they would like the ability to jump back to the disability screens


**SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**

- would want to include 'send an email' in the 'unable to reach you' accordion section

**REVIEW**



**SUBMIT**

- participant notes that there is no tracking info - no confirmation 
- participant expects to see some form of tracking number that says your claim application is in progress, utilize this number to track it.

## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?

P: I like how it looks. the fonts are easy to read for the eyes. Maybe a chat or a number I can call anytime I'm stuck somewhere. And maybe the DSLogon to upload my information there. 

- would also like to have a time frame for when you might receive a phone call


C: [if they've gone through the BDD process on paper] What do you think of this process versus the paper process you've gone through?



C: If you had a magic wand and could change one thing about this process, what would it be?

P: Nothing comes up to mind. I've addressed the wants and needs earlier. 



C: What was the best part about this process?

C: most frustrating or confusing part?
