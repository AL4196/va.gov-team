# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 1 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian Valla] and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the appeals process on VA.gov, specifically an appeals process that we call a Higher Level Review.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. In reality, we're testing our online services, in order to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Both positive and negative feedback is very welcome.

- During part of our session today, you'll be interacting with a prototype of a website. The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. But, dont worry, I will guide you along. Of course none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Start recording.

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

Before we look at the prototype of the website, let’s start with a few general questions.

Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of promts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)

P: Marine, [city], [state]



## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

C: Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?


C: How did you file it (alone or with a VSO)? Mail or in an office?


C: Tell me about how it was to go through this process.


C: What were the hardest parts?


C: What was most confusing within this process?


C: Was there anything in particular that was helpful in this process?


C: If you would do it again, would you do anything different?


C: Do you have any other comments about this process?


## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)

You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.

**Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]**

P: Uhm, first thing is, I'll be very frank: this information isn't even good - it's like they don't even want you to know this. You're gonna kill our budget if you're gonna ask us to pay out. That's not our problem, we just wanna move through it quickly. I wouldn't even go here. As an officer, I'm pretty well-read. Just to start, I wouldn't even get here. But yeah, if I got here....no idea. That's the problem. You wouldn't spend hours on this - days. You'd spend days. I dunno where to go here. 

C: Where do you think this information might be?

P: What am I looking for?

C: Applying for benefits before you separate from the military.

P: Service member benefits would be my guess, but it's way hidden down here on the left side. The VA likes to say their website is intuitive, but ti's not very intuitive to me. Service member benefits, should I try that?

C: Sure!

P: First one I would probably click on was here, but if I were getting close to separating I'd click on (the second link).

P: No. Nope. (can't find information).

C: (Christian shows where it is)

P: Yeah see, this is all hidden in here. BDD should be up here (where the link is).


## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

**How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)**

**INFO PAGE**

P: so I'll go down to 'can I file my claim online'. So you want me to file electronically, correct?

C: Yeah, online.

P: Ok..first thing I'm gonna do is look this page over. first thing that pops up, is green, so most likely I'd click here.

C: We can imagine youre still in active duty.

P: Okay..

C: You can click on the what is BDD link.

P: Yeah, there's hundreds of thousands of pages on the VA website. How much deeper do you have to go to find it?

C: Yeah, understandable. What do you think about this opening in a new tab on your computer?

P: I'm okay with them opening a new tab, yeah.

(user closes out of tab)

P: Now I see this (file a BDD claim button)...should I? Shouldn't I? There's too many times where I heard people say 'you shouldn't have done that.' Sorry, I didn't read that on page 10,007.


**INTRO PAGE**

- liked having phone numnber or someone to call
- if there was a chat function, that would be helpful
- participant clicks sign in to file BDD
- comments: 'would read more on it'


**SERVICE MEMBER INFO**



**MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY**



**DISABILITIES**

- On 'don't know name of condition': "yep, that seems pretty straighforward"

**NECK SPRAIN**



**TINNITUS**

**ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS**




**SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**

P: Is there a way they can text you so you know to get a call from a particular area code or phone number (and time frame)?

P: what happens if I miss a phone call?

- user finds alert box helpful



**REVIEW**

P: I'd start clicking on all of this just to verify it's correct.

On private medical records: "there may be more out there, because the VA doesn't know. So this could be maybe adding more (add a facility) if there's anything more out there."


**SUBMIT**

P: If there was some type of number here - I've got a number I can sort of find it. I don't get this warm feeling of 'here's the page for your records'. 


## Potential Followup questions

If there is time and moderator feels like he needs more information about the pages the user went through, he may ask them to go back and answer one or more of the probing questions below.

Before clicking on anything, explore this page and let me know what you think the main purpose of this page is.
Do you think this page accomplishes this purpose?
What is most confusing or unclear on this page?
What is most helpful on this page?
What could be added to this page to make it more useful or clear?


## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?

P: I liked that it seemed like it was expediting the paperwork. Getting it into the system, not having to send it through the US mail, you don't have someone else putting this info in maybe making a mistake, that's all good.

P: I could've printed this off too, right? 

C: Yes.

P: Yeah to print it off for the details. Print button would be great. Some guys forget to do that.


C: If you had a magic wand and could change one thing about this process, what would it be?

P: I saw the 82 days...because this gets submitted, then it just goes into outer space. There's a phone # down here which is good, but nobody answers that phone. Maybe there's some kind of contact in an email. 


C: most frustrating or confusing part?

P: Getting to Benefits delivery at discharge. It's not written anywhere and I didn't hear anything about this.

C: What do you think was the most helpful part of this flow?

P: Talking to you! I wouldn't be done with this right now  - I'd be afraid I'd fall through the ice here and not sure if I did anything right. 


Any other comments?

P: FAQs - frequently asked questions. But not so obvious of questions.



*Christian goes through thank you and closing*
