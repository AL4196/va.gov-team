# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 1 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian Valla] and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the benefits process on VA.gov, specifically a benefits process that we call Benefits Delivery at Discharge.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. In reality, we're testing our online services, in order to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Both positive and negative feedback is very welcome.

- During part of our session today, you'll be interacting with a prototype of a website. The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. But, dont worry, I will guide you along. Of course none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Start recording.

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

Before we look at the prototype of the website, let’s start with a few general questions.

Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of promts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)



## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

C: Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?

P: No not yet. I'm still active but I'm getting ready to start doing that.

C: Have you looked into it?

P: I went into the transition class so I know a little bit about it.



## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)

You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.

**Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]**

P: Alright, to me, I would think it's under disability but...you're talking claim, so...so if I was trying to find a claim but maybe it would be a VA disability increase? This is probably where I'd start. Go to evidence needed, so I knew what I needed for my doctors, so that's explanatory and useful.

P: That's kinda how I'd go to do that.

C: So do you think this is more for BDD or general?

P: Describe what BDD is again?

C: We have a program that allows you to apply for disability while you're in active duty.

P: So I do know, while on active duty, that there are windows of time frame 90-180 days on active duty where I would work through a VSO like DAV and I would do that. I just requested my medical records and once I get that, I can go through my rep to do that. But I'm not sure how I'd go on VA and do that myself.

C: There is a page on va.gov that speaks exactly to that program. Let's take a couple minutes to see if you can find it without me giving yuou any clues.

P: ok.

*Participant finds page*

C: This is the page I was hoping you'd find. How was it finding this?

P: So I would say, unless you go through the course, and honestly I forget the name of it, it's a liiiitle difficult to find here. Because it's not really jumping out. At all. 

C: Anything that could improve this?

P: I would like to see where it says 'you're getting out of the military. Theses are the things you need to do.' Either you're retiring or separating from the military, go here. Matter of fact, a lot of that is not on this page (home page and navigation).I would add a section on the homepage that's like 'you're getting out'. 


## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

**How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)**

**INFO PAGE**

P: I would be able to find out my eligibility right here so that's helpful - if you had a bad knee it could put your back outta whack. So yeah I would start with finding out if I were eligible, then 2. if I find out I'm eligible, I would call a rep or VSO to discuss with them. 


**INTRO PAGE**

C: How do you feel about this taking you to a new tab (clicked on BDD link)?

P: Uhhhh I think that's fine...this took me to the page that I had a hard time finding (laughs) I still think you need this under transition assistance. This doesn't give me enough info to make me think this is for the INITIAL, original claim. 

P: I think the button should be below the information. I would wipe out the top button here, follow these steps, then hit start.


**SERVICE MEMBER INFO**




**MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY**



**DISABILITIES**

C: What would you expect to happen if you typed 'neck sprain' in here?

P: what would be nice is, at that point, either a symptom description or something actual - you don't want people going on WebMD to figure it out, so if they don't know, you should be able to say something from their medical record - let's say sprain class 1, but if I don't have that info being able to put it in this way helps.

C: Okay.

P: Common medical terms, so the VA knows what that is. There needs to be language that makes sense to the medical coding.

**NECK SPRAIN**



**TINNITUS**

P: I might give another option (for service connected disability). I just don't know if there's something else that you mgiht be able to add and type in. Put in other - and then write in to further explain it.



**ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS**




**SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**

C: What would you expect to see if you clicked this here?

P: I would like to see that it actually uploaded it here. 

C: Got it.

**EXAM SCHEDULE ACCORDION**

P: it would be nice if you got a notification of a phone call so it said 'hey, call us back' kinda thing. There are so many numbers ghosting out there right now. WOuld also be nice to have info on why and when I need an exam.

**REVIEW**




**SUBMIT**

P: No this is good. I like the 'track the status' to have a button to allow you to do that.

C: Any other thoughts?

P: No I think that's it. THat was good though.


## Potential Followup questions

If there is time and moderator feels like he needs more information about the pages the user went through, he may ask them to go back and answer one or more of the probing questions below.

Before clicking on anything, explore this page and let me know what you think the main purpose of this page is.
Do you think this page accomplishes this purpose?
What is most confusing or unclear on this page?
What is most helpful on this page?
What could be added to this page to make it more useful or clear?


## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?

P: I think it's good - like I said, if you make it more evident what you want to do like a transition checklist, that would be really good and then the only other real problem I foresee happening, is joe-blow non medical guy entering info and that's therefore wrong. 


C: If you had a magic wand and could change one thing about this process, what would it be?

P: It's hard to say...the walkthrough was fine, I think the only thing is that I'm wondering if you could have someone available while someone is doing it, to help. There's someone ready to help if you need it.

C: Like a chat function?

P: Yeah like a chat function. 



C: What was the best part about this process?

C: most frustrating or confusing part?

P: Uhhh...I think the only thing that will give people problems, is how easy it is to pull individual page for people. There's 20-something year of med record, and how do I just give you page 35? I could probably figure that out but maybe some less technical guy may not be able to.

C: What do you think was the most helpful part of this flow?

P: I think that just having it online is useful. The other piece is that it wasn't easy to find that page. If you could make that very plain it would make it perfect.

C: Any other comments?

P: No.
