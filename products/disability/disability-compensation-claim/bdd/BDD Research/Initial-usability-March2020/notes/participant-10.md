DATE/TIME OF INTERVIEW: [date] at [time] PM EST

# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 1 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian Valla] and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the appeals process on VA.gov, specifically an appeals process that we call a Higher Level Review.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. In reality, we're testing our online services, in order to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Both positive and negative feedback is very welcome.

- During part of our session today, you'll be interacting with a prototype of a website. The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. But, dont worry, I will guide you along. Of course none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Start recording.

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

Before we look at the prototype of the website, let’s start with a few general questions.

Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of promts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)

- I live in [state] and I retired from the Navy in 2013



## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

C: Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?


C: How did you file it (alone or with a VSO)? Mail or in an office?


C: Tell me about how it was to go through this process.


C: What were the hardest parts?


C: What was most confusing within this process?


C: Was there anything in particular that was helpful in this process?


C: If you would do it again, would you do anything different?


C: Do you have any other comments about this process?


## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)

You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.

**Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]**

P: Ok, I would go to the search button...and I'm just gonna search for 'active duty apply VA disability comepnsation'. (hits search)

P: Ok, so I'm going to click on the top one. (goes to ebenefits). 

(user clicks on disability page)

P: it doesn't jump out at a person...If I was active duty I wouldn't think that was an option for me.


(user was unable to find page - Christian indicated to move on)


## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

**How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)**

**INFO PAGE**

P: First I would click on 'find out if you're eligible for VA disability compensation benefits'. I would read about what docs I would need to provide...find out what evidence we will need for your claim...I find it kind of odd that it's not asking for statement of service.

P: Yeah I would click on 'let's get started'.

P: based upon your info you MAY be eligible...can I click on that?

C: Yeah you can do that.

P: Ok. (clicks on it)

C: So this is the page I had intended for you to go in the first part (task one). Any thoughts about this?

P: I think this should be in the beginning...what's confusing too is 'reasons why I can't use the BDD program'. It doesn't tell me what I can do then. And it would be nice if there was a link where you could put in your zip code of where you're gonna be living. Because what happens if you file a claim when you're on station?

C: Ok, let's go back. You mentioned that you 'may be' eligible is a bit confusing. 

P: yeah I think there should be a separate page for the 'maybes' and the 'let's get started' makes them think they can do it.

- Participant suggests 'statement of service' being in there
- In person - let people know about offices being closed for COVID-19


**INTRO PAGE**

- It's nice that the form is saved
- confusing - would like the steps to follow above the sign in


**SERVICE MEMBER INFO**




**MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY**


- if you have different periods of service, being able to add that in

**DISABILITIES**

- confused about 'new' conditions. This is confusing if doing it for the first time
- Participant wants ability to add several conditions at once


**NECK SPRAIN**



**TINNITUS**

**ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS**




**SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**


P: "most people don't know what a lay statement is"

C: You said wow. What were you thinking?

P: You can upload up to 500 pages. But maybe in the beginning before they even start, let them know if there's a limit to what they can do. 

- Participant believes something should be mentioned about the record being reviewed and that any other conditions that can be claimed, we will do so for you or something to that effect.
- Participant likes the 'unfamiliar phone number' alert

**REVIEW**




**SUBMIT**

- Check status - Participant believes that you can only check on ebenefits 


## Potential Followup questions

If there is time and moderator feels like he needs more information about the pages the user went through, he may ask them to go back and answer one or more of the probing questions below.

Before clicking on anything, explore this page and let me know what you think the main purpose of this page is.
Do you think this page accomplishes this purpose?
What is most confusing or unclear on this page?
What is most helpful on this page?
What could be added to this page to make it more useful or clear?


## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?


P: I think it will be good for someone who has only been in for a few years and doesn't have a lot of issues. Someone who has been in for a while has a lot of stuff. There's no one to ask questions to, really. 


C: If you had a magic wand and could change one thing about this process, what would it be?

P: The limit of how many things you can claim. If you have more than 10, say, things to claim, then you have to go to your VSO. Bceause to scan that and send it, I just...I dunno.



C: What was the best part about this process?

P: I guess that it's an option to do it online.

C: most frustrating or confusing part?



C: What do you think was the most helpful part of this flow?



Any other comments?

P: Maybe a chat or someone to talk to. I think having a phone number [to call] because I've never gotten good customer service from chat.


*Christian goes through thank you and closing*
