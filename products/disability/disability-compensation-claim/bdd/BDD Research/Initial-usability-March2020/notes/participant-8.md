DATE/TIME OF INTERVIEW: [3/20/20] at [1:00] PM EST

# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 1 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian Valla] and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the appeals process on VA.gov, specifically an appeals process that we call a Higher Level Review.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. In reality, we're testing our online services, in order to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Both positive and negative feedback is very welcome.

- During part of our session today, you'll be interacting with a prototype of a website. The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. But, dont worry, I will guide you along. Of course none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Start recording.

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

Before we look at the prototype of the website, let’s start with a few general questions.

Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of promts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)



## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

C: Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?

P: I have, I was trying to do it before I separated. I ran into multiple issues with VSOs who were unwilling to help me. 

P: When I was 180 days out, I was speaking to different VSOs even before then in the MD or VA area, and different VSOs would say things like 'you had to do your claim where you were going to be'. They were telling me that they couldn't initiate my claim in RI. The other roadblock - they said they would not do a BDD claim because they have a high percentage return and they had to appeal.



## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)

You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.

**Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]**

P: First I would start scrolling like I am right now and look where I could submit a claim. So I would click on 'file a claim for compensation'. That was pretty easy to find.

P: I'm looking for the words BDD or something like that...I think I would just search, honestly. (goes to search) I prefer the search feature on websites. (search results show) I would click on pre-discharge claim.


C: This is the page I was hoping you'd find. How was it finding this?

P: I like that it was the first thing but I don't like that it doesn't actually work. (the page was not found for some reason)

C: Anything that could improve this?

P: Just that the page would work.


## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

**How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)**

**INFO PAGE**

P: let's see...I think I would just 'get started'.


**INTRO PAGE**

- user states that the overall feel - "doesn't feel new at all, somewhat familiar so that's a good thing"
- user signs in and clicks 'start a discharge claim'
- States that they would not read the stuff below the 'start' button
- "I don't read a lot of instructions unless I'm lost"
- remove button - suggestion if you want people to read steps



**SERVICE MEMBER INFO**

- finish this app later - on ebenefits it says something like 'we will save your session right here and you can start right back'
- Gives user reassurance


**BANK ACCOUNT**

- Maybe there could be info on VA protecting information


**MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY**

- 


**DISABILITIES**

- PROGRESS BAR - comment on percentage to illustrate how far along you are

P: (what if I don't know name of condition) - "If I clicked on this I would expect to see, maybe a list or tree.

**NECK SPRAIN**

- Participant not sure if the previous page was necessary (asking about previous conditions)

- Required block - "I think if I had a lot of things, I might copy/paste a few reasons"

**TINNITUS**



**ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS**




**SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**

- "I would hit service treatment records here"
- "It would be nice if you could select multiple files and upload them all at the same time"



**REVIEW**





**SUBMIT**

- "I think printing through the web browser is fine"


## Potential Followup questions

If there is time and moderator feels like he needs more information about the pages the user went through, he may ask them to go back and answer one or more of the probing questions below.

Before clicking on anything, explore this page and let me know what you think the main purpose of this page is.
Do you think this page accomplishes this purpose?
What is most confusing or unclear on this page?
What is most helpful on this page?
What could be added to this page to make it more useful or clear?


## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?


P: I liked how user friendly it was, however I would like a better idea where I am in the process and maybe take a couple clicks away. I think you could group that together. 


C: [if they've gone through the BDD process on paper] What do you think of this process versus the paper process you've gone through?




C: If you had a magic wand and could change one thing about this process, what would it be?



C: What was the best part about this process?

C: most frustrating or confusing part?



C: What do you think was the most helpful part of this flow?



Any other comments?
