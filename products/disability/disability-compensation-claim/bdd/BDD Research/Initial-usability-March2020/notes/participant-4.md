DATE/TIME OF INTERVIEW: [3/18/20] at [3:00] PM EST

# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 1 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian Valla] and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the appeals process on VA.gov, specifically an appeals process that we call a Higher Level Review.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. In reality, we're testing our online services, in order to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Both positive and negative feedback is very welcome.

- During part of our session today, you'll be interacting with a prototype of a website. The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. But, dont worry, I will guide you along. Of course none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Start recording.

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

Before we look at the prototype of the website, let’s start with a few general questions.

Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of promts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)

P: I did do a usability interview about a year ago for a GI Bill website. 

P: I'm in [city], recently separated from Navy but still in reserves.



## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

C: Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?


C: How did you file it (alone or with a VSO)? Mail or in an office?


C: Tell me about how it was to go through this process.


C: What were the hardest parts?


C: What was most confusing within this process?


C: Was there anything in particular that was helpful in this process?


C: If you would do it again, would you do anything different?


C: Do you have any other comments about this process?


## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)

You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.

**Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]**

P: I would expect to see it in a popup over here or in this dropdown (navigation).

(user goes to service-member-benefits page)

P: Yeah so if I'm putting myself back in that time frame, I would go to service member benefits. It's not really jumping out at me. There's a section for benefits to consider when separating. 

C: What kind of words or terms are you looking for?

P: I guess I'm looking for it by title, right? So umm...pre-discharge disability claim? 

C: Do you think this is the page we were looking for?

P: I didn't have any claims when I separated but I didn't know if every claim was a disability so I went over it.

C: This is the page I was hoping you'd find. How was it finding this?

P: Might be my lack of knowledge but disability and BDD don't mean the same thing to me. I thought it was something different. 

C: Anything that could improve this?

P: I think that benefits delivery at discharge should be called out here (sidebar). I just think that if we're gonna call it a specific thing then it should be clearer by name.


## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

**How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)**

**INFO PAGE**

P: I guess I'm assuming that I already know that I'm eligible and I already have evidence and if those assumptions are correct, I'm gopnna click on this here (let's get started button).

P: I have stuff entered, I may be eligible, so I would just click here.

C: what would you expect to see if you click on 'learn more about BDD?'

P: Either a pop up or a new tab.

C: What do you think about that?

P: I'd prefer it go to new tab, because you're in a step by step process and I think it would be counterintuitive if you have to come back to this part in the process and lose your spot.


**INTRO PAGE**

P: just kinda reading through...I assume I haven't done this yet so I'll sign in. It kinda gives me a rundown, and I can start this...


**SERVICE MEMBER INFO**

P: This is all fine but a lot of this info is all on file, and I think so long as there is a way to pull that in.

C: You would expect ot have this information all there?

P: yeah if you had already given that information it would be pretty annoying [to input again].




**MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY**



**DISABILITIES**

P: so I have disabilities to add here, right?

C: yes. What would you expect to see if you clicked on 'don't know name of confdition?'

P: This is what I expect, yeah. So in this case, I want to add another. Is there any way I can find another box or add another condition? Or maybe just another sentence that says 'if you have more than one condition you will enter it after'.

**NECK SPRAIN**

P: (in regards to 'ask a few questions about disability' screen) I'm getting a very generic sentence here, and I feel like this could all just be on the same page.



**TINNITUS**

**ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS**

C: Do you expect those to be together on the same page (aid and attendance bennies and vehicle and home mods)?

P: Yeah I mean I think they are kinda related and maybe they could be combined to be more streamlined.


**SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**

P: So yeah I'd upload them...ok. 

C: Where you clicked on the dropdown, what would expect to see here?


P: I think it would be...I'm not sure what to say because I can't speak too intelligently to range of records, but I would think it was something to narrow down what kind of record I'm uploading, like a specific exam or a label for a particular doc that I have.


P: Is there any reason why the upload section doesn't look like this? You already know you're gonna be uploading a file so why do you have to go to antoher page? It seems strange that I'm doing so many steps. To me, it seems by me clicking yes here I'm already saying I wanna do this so this doesn't need to be here, so then I just pick my file. I think there are a lot of screens that can be consolidated into less screens.

P: It would be great on this (summary of disabilities) page if you could have an add button or go back to adding a disability.

C: what's on this page (supporting evidence screen)?

P: Rundown of what to expect on this page.

C: what would you expect to see if you clicked on 'what happens if I miss a call?'

P: I've reached a point with spam calls where I don't ever answer it. Hopefully whoever calls leaves a voicemail, but if not, maybe a rundown of when they'll call again. Or maybe on your profile where it tells you 'hey, we tried to call you on the 12th' or something.

C: What about the claim exam? What do you expect to see there?

P: Maybe to confirm your claim amount - what it's gonna be?


**REVIEW**

P: Ok, so summarizes everything...yeah I think this is good. This is great that you give the opportunity to edit here. So this is kinda the same thing we were talking about is that we could change the disability instead of having to go all the way back.

C: Do you think that you are expecting to be able to add a disability?

P: No, no I think it should just allow me to go back.

**SUBMIT**

P: Yeah this is good, I think it's straightforward, overall I think it's a short application. I appreciate how this app is overall short.

C: Take a look at this page and let me know if anything is confusing.




## Potential Followup questions

If there is time and moderator feels like he needs more information about the pages the user went through, he may ask them to go back and answer one or more of the probing questions below.

Before clicking on anything, explore this page and let me know what you think the main purpose of this page is.
Do you think this page accomplishes this purpose?
What is most confusing or unclear on this page?
What is most helpful on this page?
What could be added to this page to make it more useful or clear?


## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?


P: I think it's good. 


C: If you had a magic wand and could change one thing about this process, what would it be?

P: I think it would be minimizing some of the words or redundant screens. Maybe could group like things in the same pages and make it less words.


C: What was the best part about this process?

C: Most frustrating or confusing part?

P: I didn't think anything was confusing.

C: What do you think was the most helpful part of this flow?

P: I think the dropdowns and other tools that they provided explanations or amplifying instructions were well placed and clear.

C: Any other comments?

P: I thought it was pretty easy, but I would revert back to what we talked about in the beginning. A little bit clearer on the main page what the link was going to. But just the description of BDD on that page.
