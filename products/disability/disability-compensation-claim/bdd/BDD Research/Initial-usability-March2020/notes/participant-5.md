DATE/TIME OF INTERVIEW: [3/19/20] at [11] AM EST

# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 1 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian Valla] and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the benefits process on VA.gov, specifically a benefits process that we call Benefits Delivery at Discharge.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. In reality, we're testing our online services, in order to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Both positive and negative feedback is very welcome.

- During part of our session today, you'll be interacting with a prototype of a website. The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. But, dont worry, I will guide you along. Of course none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Start recording.

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

Before we look at the prototype of the website, let’s start with a few general questions.

Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of promts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)

P: I live in [city], [state] area and in the Navy - they seem to like my feedback for user interfaces.



## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

C: Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?

P: I don't think so...maybe I have but it's not something I know a lot about.



## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)

You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.

**Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]**

P: Ok, so I'm going to go to va benefits and health care, it looks like service member benefits....and let's see...obviously I already know about the GI bill, va home loan, and the life insurance. I always get those to ask me to help them at the worst times (laughs) right when I'm trying to do something I get a popup that asks if you can help us (laughs). BDD sounds like exactly what you were talking about.


C: This is the page I was hoping you'd find. How was it finding this?

P: Not bad, obviously I had to scroll a little bit but it wasnt that hard.



## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

**How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)**

INFO PAGE

P: So I wanna get benefits, but I might expand this but it doesn't look like it works.

C: Yeah not everything works.

P: I would click on 'find out if you're eligible first' but it didn't let me click that.

C: Sure so you would look at that.

P: (clicks lets get started)

SECOND GO THRU (Christian asks participant to go through steps again as participant did so quickly)

Participant thought summaries: 

- the sidebar should be 'sticky'
- why do I need to go down so far to get to the button?
- Can I file my claim online should be way higher
- I know there are other ways to file it - I'm online already
- Not sure if all the content is necessary on the screen - mentioned before I wanted to click on get bennies 
- Let's get started should be its own page


**INTRO PAGE**

P: this is a little confusing because there are two sign ins...it's confusing bceause I don't know which one to pick. The blue one says I can save my work but the green one seems like it might work too. 


P: I'm looking at them and thinking I want to click the blue one but feel like the green one works. Honestly the system should just save it. I shouldn't have to worry about it.

SECOND GO THRU

- my pet peeve - which sign in button do I click? I'm gonna try blue this time because I tried green last time


**SERVICE MEMBER INFO**

P: this is me...my email address is already in, ok good...my bank account...I dunno why they need my bank account info.

C: Do you think this is unnecessary because they should already have it, or...?

P: Well I mean this is personal info, so why are they asking for my bank account before I even have a chance to get anything?

C: gotcha.

SECOND GO THRU

- Why store my bank account info if I might not get my money? (Maybe we could let the user know why they're giving their info)

**MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY**




**DISABILITIES**




**NECK SPRAIN**



**TINNITUS**

**ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS**




**SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**

P: I dunno, it seems like they're asking for more info too early then...if they already know what I have in my military record. It feels like they're digging more than they should this early in the process.

**REVIEW**

P: that's weird, it shouldn't have jumped. (prototype issue)


**SUBMIT**

P: alright now I've got stuff submitted...

C: Does this make sense?

P: I would try to track it to see if it was pending or if it was an established claim.

C: Any other comments?

P: Looks like I'm done. Looks like I finished.

C: This is the submission page that just indicates that you've finished.


## Potential Followup questions

If there is time and moderator feels like he needs more information about the pages the user went through, he may ask them to go back and answer one or more of the probing questions below.

Before clicking on anything, explore this page and let me know what you think the main purpose of this page is.
Do you think this page accomplishes this purpose?
What is most confusing or unclear on this page?
What is most helpful on this page?
What could be added to this page to make it more useful or clear?


## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?


P: I mean it's a little clunky because some of the things don't work the way they would - screen shouldn't jump. Overall I would say I'm comfortable with the process flow. A couple things were a little nosy a little early, asking for my bank account info and medical records. I am more than willing to give those but in the process was a little too early. Even if I went to a private physician, the military should have that info but I should choose if they should get it. 



C: What do you think was the most helpful part of this flow?

P: It didn't take that long, fairly quick. So I would say the ease of use, I don't know what it was like before. If this gives me a leg up when getting out and having everything ready, I think it was worth what it was - like 10-15 minutes.

C: This is the first time this has been online.

P: Oh wow! well that's great! I'd much rather do this than get a piece of paper.

C: Any other comments?

P: I'm very glad the VA takes the feedback of the user seriously. There's a cost to doing so. 



*Christian goes through thank you and closing*
