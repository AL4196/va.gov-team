# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 1 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian Valla] and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the benefits process on VA.gov, specifically a benefits process that we call Benefits Delivery at Discharge.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. In reality, we're testing our online services, in order to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Both positive and negative feedback is very welcome.

- During part of our session today, you'll be interacting with a prototype of a website. The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. But, dont worry, I will guide you along. Of course none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Start recording.

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

Before we look at the prototype of the website, let’s start with a few general questions.

Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of promts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)

P: I live in [state] and I was in the Navy.

C: You are a vet now?

P: Yes.

C: Have you heard of benefits delivery at discharge?

P: No but it would've been good when I got out. I heard about it through Reddit. I work with an org called the Warrior Scholar Project. They're pretty amazing, they do from the battlefield to the classroom - anyway I'm pretty active with that group. 

C: Got it. So if this were available to you, you would've used it?

P: Oh yes. My life would've been much different if I had.



## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

C: Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?


C: How did you file it (alone or with a VSO)? Mail or in an office?


C: Tell me about how it was to go through this process.


C: What were the hardest parts?


C: What was most confusing within this process?


C: Was there anything in particular that was helpful in this process?


C: If you would do it again, would you do anything different?


C: Do you have any other comments about this process?


## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)

You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.

**Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]**

HOME PAGE

P: It's not readily apparent....if I was doing this I would have something up here that says 'first time visitor?' (nvaigation bar) then you can take them to the dumb dumb stuff. A lot of people will look down here and say 'gee wiz this is a whole lotta junk'. And when people are looking for a resource, they're kinda in a bind. They're jacked up and trying to find out what's next. 

C: Well think about what you might do, even though this is not easily apparent.

P: I suppose I would click on 'check my claim or appeal status.' But they don't even have a login or ID.me or anything like that. 

C: Is there anywhere else you think you might be able to find that information?

P: See you have this footer right here, you'd think the page is over. But then you see all this stuff down here.



## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

**How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)**

**INFO PAGE**

P: I would say 'what's my eligibility' there, evidence and supporting documents...you need the link there to give them the supporting documents there. Yeah that would be needed there and then the claim forms from here would go to bullet point 3. I would say that somewhere in here you have the right to utilize veterans services (VSO) etc. Making them aware that they have the ability to use a VSO.

P: Yeah and supporting documents from family members...yeah that's a clusterf$#k right there. You have to have these things in your hands before you can even file anything. This whole block here will do more to prevent people from applying than anything else. 

P: This (can I file online?) needs to be up top, because that demystifies it a bit. And that's a friendly thing to throw to somebody.


**INTRO PAGE**


P: This is great. This is smooth and it's not mad at you. 

C: Can you say what's wrong with the sign in process?

P: It's not in any kind of rational order. It's like a bunch of special needs kids put it in a box and kicked it down a hill. And ID.me is not a governmentt org and you're wondering why you're giving them all that information. 


**SERVICE MEMBER INFO**

P: Bank account! Ha! That's a lot of things people will be saying 'why will I be doing that?' All of a sudden you are trusting something that you don't understand.

C: What would help you with this?

P: It says that they WILL be paying your disability benefits right now! So yeah, it's a bit premature. Once you complete the application say 'you've submitted this thing, now in order for you to have your benefits deposited correctly to you bank account, we need your bank info at this time'. This is making a certain assumption taht you're going to get a benefit. And you're REAL vulnerable when you get out. All of a sudden you're handing over your banking info for something that may or may not work. 


**MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY**



**DISABILITIES**



**NECK SPRAIN**



**TINNITUS**



**ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS**

P: this is WAY premature. this is something that should occur after they have put in their claim. This is just more info that is really not necessary. They would only got an additional DNC if they got 100%. 

P: Auto allowance and adaptive benefits yeah, don't do that. Don't do that. That don't even apply until you're up around 70, and that applies with amputation. But throwing this at them right now even when they didn't finish the application, no.


**SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**

P: and asking where they can find evidence, that's really a rabbit hole. The quesion here is 'what percentage of your medical care has come from the VA?' and then that way if someone says 100%, then all of the rest of this gathering supporting evidence, stops. It's gonna take you 6 weeks to get any info, you gotta ask for a release, all that. 

P: It kinda goes to the issue of 'who has these records?'. There should be a process where you request medical records from the VA and then the VA gets medical records from the doctors. The doc offices don't have the capacity to deal with every nitwit that calls, then they'll say you need a release form, then that happens, etc.

C: so what you're saying is that this step should not be in the flow because the VA should be reaching out to doctors?

P: Yeah, because when the VA contacts a doctor they will listen. But when some nitwit comes and asks for it, they just go 'what'?

P: People from the Vietnam or Korea era, they know nothing about uploading documentation.


**REVIEW**

P: Service treatment records should be a permanent 'yes'. If you disallow that any point in the transaction then they will be denied. They should never have to support or provide that supporting evidence.



**SUBMIT**

P: How do I print the page? I would like a button. To print it. That would just transform it into a printable thing. If you do comamnd + p this won't print.

## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?

P: I liked that it's available. That they're not just getting kicked out and left to figure it out on their own. And it's changing the dynamic on how the benefits are delivered. People are able to start their GI bill. When I got it out was horrible. GI Bill was terrible. 




C: Any other comments?
