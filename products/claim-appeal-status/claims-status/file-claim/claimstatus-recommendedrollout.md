# Claim Status Roll out suggestions

1. Release vets.gov claim status, no public release/announcement (mid-late october)
  - Claim status will cover all of claim status, no longer just disability claims
    - **Note** May need to alter Claim Status charter to include other stakeholders (at least Pension)
  - Content needed temporarily to explain that there may be a difference between eben and vets.gov claim status
  - Can do this as we have consolidated all of the central part of the steps which usually are what differ
  - **Risk** - Those that have extensive estimated completion dates will be also showing in Vets.gov
  - **Need Review / subset** - Not all claims will have the 5103 items in it, will need to document these...
    - Potentially move the 5103 indicator item to be connected with the 5103 Tracked Item as this will allow for a more pinpointed service return and not require us to determine which claim types it is actually associated with.
  
2. Monitor what is displaying in production, make alterations if necessary

3. Prior to release, provide Sheila/Contact Center with New phases and screenshots of Claim Status feature
  - This will include new phase information, how the screens look, functionality, etc.
  - eBenefits Claim Status will still be functional at this point.
  - They will need to alter their scripts and the display of the phases
  
4. Once we determine we're good in vets.gov (Oct/Nov) within eBenefits, we will request a link/content in Claim Status for the opportunity to go to vets.gov claim status with the disclaimer that information may appear differently (content tbd). This link will go straight to the claim status page within vets.gov but require the vets.gov login prior to entering the page. SSO will most likely not be available.
  - This request should be put in by the end of October to allow EVSS time to add in the content, their Claim Status feature however should be individually deployable and not have as many roadblocks as some others

5. Monitor call center feedback / eben / vets.gov feedback regarding claim status
  - Expectation is that contact centers will feel a bit of an uptake in calls
  
5. Complete the 526EZ form in vets.gov (estimated Dec-Jan)
6. (Also ensure disabilities/rating info are in vets.gov)
7. In January/beginning of February, turn off claim status and the 526EZ in eBenefits.
  - Within the "Work in Process" page in EVSS have them add content/link within the Claim Status accordian to link the Veteran to vets.gov
  - Within these linkages, we need to ensure that the Veteran understands why they are being redirected from eBenefits and why they have to go through ID.me, etc. 
  
## Goal: 
Move all Compensation Disability Benefits items from eBenefits to vets.gov by Feb 1 and turn off those pages in ebenefits.
    - Question will be what happens to these featuers in SEP as we shut them down in eBenefits (POA users will see the old pages, that will no longer match what the contact center sees)

## Long Term:
 Eventually the EVSS Backend will need to be replaced by new and direct services with BGS so that the EVSS Framework can be turned off.
