Good morning everyone,

Let’s move forward with this.  If you hear of complaints from the Veterans, please let me know and then we can re-visit it.

Thanks for your patience and your support.

Sincerely,
Bettye

Subject: Removal of VRE Claim Types from Claim Status Scope

Hi Bettye, here is a brief write up. If I am missing something, please let me know. 

Removing VRE from All Claims Iteration of Claim Status (and thus removing it from eBenefits Claim Status)

Brief:  Claim Status is rolling out the 2nd iteration to include all Claim Types that are displaying in eBenefits. This is based on a column in the database that determines if a Claim Type (EP+Claim Label) is displayed to Veterans via an electronic source (now it will be both ebenefits and vets.gov). 

Recommendation: Remove the VRE Claim Types 095, 295, etc from Claim Status Feature in both Vets.gov and eBenefits. 
   (This means turning those specific Claim EP’s and Claim Labels to the aforementioned Database table.)
   The suggestion for this is to wait for VRE to have a steady Case Management System in place and then have VRE work with Vets.gov on a case management status feature. (The timeline for this would be determined once VRE has a stable case management system in place for long term use – whether this is the CRM-VRE CMS or an alternative.)

Reason:  The only portion of the VRE process that displays within Claim Status is the Eligibility determination portion. This part of the process only happens with a small subset of those Servicemembers/Veterans applying for the benefit. What displays in Claim Status is also only this small subset of the overall VRE process while also trying to use a template created primarily for Compensation and Pension Claims. And while the Memorandum rating process is quite similar to this process, it does not represent the whole of the VRE Case Management process which may be misleading to Veterans looking at these items in claim status. 

To be clear, turning these specific Claim Types off in the Database would shut off these items in both eBenefits and in Vets.gov. eBenefits does not currently advertise Claim Status for the VRE process.


Best,
-Josh
