# User Stories for MVP focused on "track"

### Key takeaways from Frog research

The three primary things a veteran wants to know are:

1. What's going on now?
2. How long will it take?
3. What happens next?

### Prioritized user stories
*Aligned with the 3 key takeaways above, ordered by user importance/need - what does a veteran want to see and do first when checking claim status?*

1. As a Veteran, I want to see which actions have been taken on my claim so that I understand what's going on
 - Progress through broad steps of claim status, e.g. Gathering of Evidence --> Review of Evidence
 - Granular status updates, e.g. requested evidence received, request closed, C&P exam appointment scheduled
2. As a Veteran, I want to see an estimate of how long it will take for my claim to be completed, so that I know when I may begin receiving compensation
3. As a Veteran, I want to see what the VA needs from me, so that I can deliver it and keep my claim moving
4. As a Veteran, I want to upload the documents the VA needs from me so that I can keep my claim moving
 - For each request, I want to be able to upload as many documents as I need to (not just one) and select the type for each of them
5. As a Veteran, I want to see that the VA has received the documents I have submitted, so that I know I'm not holding up the process
 - I also want to see documents that have been submitted by others
6. As a Veteran, I want to upload optional documents in support of my claim, so that I can strengthen the case for the claim to be accepted
7. As a Veteran, I want to see documents the VA is requesting of others, so that I understand what's happening when the status doesn't appear to move
 - I also want to be able to upload these documents if I have them, so that I can keep my claim moving
8. As a Veteran whose claim outcome I disagree with (rejected or unsatisfactory rating), I want to know what my options are
 - File a disagreement --> eBenefits
 - Reopen my claim --> eBenefits
9. As a Veteran, I want to be able to request a claim decision when I have submitted all my evidence, so that I can move my claim faster
10. As a Veteran, I want to see when multiple applications I've filed have been consolidated into one claim, so I understand why only one claim shows up on vets.gov
11. As a Veteran whose estimated completion date has changed, I want to understand the reason the date has changed
 - Change from being processed as fully developed to standard
 - Additional time required for reviewing or gathering evidence
 - Tracked item past due date
 - Other?
12. As a Veteran, I want to see when I submitted my claim so that I know how long it's been under review

1. As a Veteran, I want to see what the VA is doing with my claim, so that I know progress is being made on it
