# UX Ideas and Improvements

### Tracked Items
- Users have trouble finding the "What we need from you" tab
  - These tracked items should be the most prominent, because they're holding up their claim
- Allow flexibility in how a veteran chooses to submit tracked items
  - Veterans have issues with mailing in documents, don't know if they're received
  - They should be able to mark a tracked item as submitted via mail

### Clarity & Transparency
- Give better support for edge cases where the estimated completion date is difficult to predict
  - Removing it altogether doesn't make the vet happy
- Minimize the appearance of backward progress
  - Instead of moving from "reviewing evidence" backward to "gathering evidence", why not move *forward* to "gathering *additional* evidence?"
- Surface micro-transactions to better inform the user and give a sense of progress
  - Any status update, no matter how small, is better than none

### Issue Resolution
- Explain issues in plain language and give a route to resolve them
  - If we say a development letter has been sent, and they haven't received it
  - If the status hasn't changed for a long time
  - If the estimated completion date has passed
  - If they sent a tracked item and the VA hasn't received it

### General Claim Status
- Bring historical claims and open claims into the same page (need to resolve performance issue)
- Think of the claims list page as a dashboard for my claims. The most important things I want to know here are:
  - If the status of a claim has changed, which could be:
    - Estimated completion date
    - Phase in the process
  - If something is needed from me
