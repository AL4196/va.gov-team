###[Opt-in setting](https://marvelapp.com/2dh4dia/screen/15305578):
As a Veteran, I want to opt-in to receive email notifications when there are updates to my claim status 

  - A setting accessible from the claims list page controls whether I receive these notifications for _all_ claims (I cannot control this setting on an individual claim basis)
  - By default, this setting is turned _Off_
  - When I turn this setting _On_, my email address is prefilled from the address linked to my user account
  - If I want to change which email address these notifications are sent to, I can edit and save my preference


### Triggers for notifications:
As a Veteran, I want to be notified of the following types of updates to my claim:

  - Claim received
  - Claim completed / decision available
  - Claim moved to another phase
  - New tracked item needed from me
  - Tracked item needed from me reminder - due in 7 days / 1 day / overdue (due 1 day ago)
  - Letter sent to request a decision (5103 notice)
  - Request decision available
