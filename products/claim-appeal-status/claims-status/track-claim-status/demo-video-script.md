# Claim Status Demo Script

#### Introduction

- Vets.gov enables Veterans to discover, apply for, track and manage the benefits they have earned. This is a demonstration of the Claim Status tracker for disability benefits on vets.gov.
- Currently, 42% of calls to the National Call Center are related to claim status


- The new claim status experience on Vets.gov aims to: 
  - Provide Veterans with clear information about what is happening and what to expect with their claim
  - Call attention to the actions a Veteran can take to support their claim

#### Claims list

- Here I can see a list of all of my disability compensation claims, with a brief summary for each claim
- I can see the current status, which corresponds to a phase in the claims process
- I can also see if there are items that need my attention, whether the VA has sent me any letters, and the date of the last update to my claim
- By selecting one of my claims I can view more details about it

#### Claim status page - overview

- Here at the top of the page I can see the type of claim and my claimed conditions
- I can view more information about my claim via 3 easy to navigate tabs
  - The Status tab shows updates and progress on my claim
  - The Files tab contains requests and notices that need my attention
  - The Details tab contains information about my claim submission
- Should I have any questions about my claim, I can find information here [sidebar] to call or submit my question to the VA online

#### Status

- On the status tab, notices that require my attention are highlighted at the top


- I can see where my claim is in the process with this timeline of steps
  - Vets.gov streamlined the timeline from 8 steps to 5 to faciliate a better understanding of the process
- Within these steps I see a detailed timeline of all of the updates for my claim, like if the VA has sent me a notice that requires my attention has reviewed evidence I've submitted
- Under the "Complete" phase, I see an estimated completion date for my claim
  - Rather than seeing a date range for estimated completion, I see just the end date of the range, which sets better expectations for Veterans about when the claim will be complete

#### Details

- On the Details tab, I can see basic details about my claim submission
  - The type of claim
  - My claimed conditions, and whether the claim for each condition is new, a reopened claim, or an increase from my current disability rating
  - The date the VA received my claim
  - If I have a representative for VA claims, I can see that information here as well

#### Files

- If I select the "View details" button in this alert message [at top of status tab], or select the Files tab, I can see notices and requests for evidence related to my claim
- File requests
  - Under "File requests", I see items that have been requested from me - called out with a yellow background - as well as items related to my claim that have been requested from other federal organizations
  - For items requested from me I can see when they're due, with overdue items highlighted in red
  - If I have additional evidence to submit that hasn't already been requested by the VA, I can do so under "Turn in more evidence"
- If I select "View Details" on one of the file requests, I can read a description of the request and upload my evidence
  - I select the file I want to upload from my computer, select the document type, and select "Submit Files for Review"
- Once my file has been uploaded, I see a confirmation message, my file is removed from File Requests and appears in the list of Documents I've filed
  - I'll see my file marked as submitted - once it has been reviewed, this label will change to "Reviewed by VA"

#### Request a claim decision

- I can request a decision on my claim from the VA if I have no more evidence to submit
- This option is made available to me at a certain point in the claims process, at which point I'll see an alert on the Status tab
- When I select "View details", I can read about the details of submitting this request, and either submit my request now or opt to do it later and continue to submit evidence

#### Completed claim

- Once my claim is complete, I see information about receiving my claim decision. I can also find information about appealing or reopening my claim to submit new evidence if I wish to do so.

#### Closing

- This has been disability claim status on vets.gov. Thank you.
