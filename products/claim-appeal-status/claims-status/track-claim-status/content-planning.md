# Content-focused Planning for Disability Claims Status

--- --- DRAFT --- ---

**There are 2 types of content for this project, hence the 2 lists below.**

## Content Type A: Standard Content

### A1. Content audit of existing pages _related to_ claim status (e.g. static content that explains claims status) 
_Goal: To get an understanding of the different pieces of content and get ready for editorial process_

 - [ ] Identify user tasks/user stories -- Suzanne/Josh/Mel
 - [ ] Identify source content and conduct content inventory (document all content in a Microsoft word file. *Note* This document will later be used to present editorial changes to lawyers and OIRA, so track changes is critical. Please keep formatting to plain text/markdown so that the document can be easily moved to GitHub.) --> SO Company

### A2. Writing and Editing
_Goal: Create & revise content in a way that is easy for users to understand_
 - [ ] Fill out Content Planning Cover Sheet that includes: --> SO Company
  - Page Title
  - Page Objective (what do we want users to DO) 
  - Primary message 
  - Suggested URL
  - Source Content
  - SME/Content Owner(s)
 - [ ] Write new content --> SO Company
 - [ ] Apply Content Scorecard (and revise as needed to improve score) --> SO Company

 - [ ] Finalize and copyedit content (if there are substantial edits from concurrence, re-edit and re-concur) --> SO Company
 - [ ] Re-apply Content Scorecard --> SO Company
 - [ ] Document needs (e.g., highlight which parts will not be needed in future, which need revision, and which do not need revision) --> Suzanne/Josh/Mel & SO Company




## Content Type B: Dynamic/Variable Content

### B1. Content audit of existing claims status UI (in ebenefits)
_Goal: To get an understanding of the different pieces of content, get ready for editorial process, and ensure new UI covers dynamic (often hidden) use cases._

 - [ ] Content Inventory - current webpages and UX documentation (document all content that a user might run into if they are trying to check their claims status, in a Microsoft word file. *Note* This document will later be used to present editorial changes to lawyers, and OIRA, so track changes is critical. Please keep formatting to plain text/markdown so that the document can be easily moved to GitHub.) --> Josh
  - Content types --> Josh
  - Sections of content --> Josh
  - When it's displayed (if it only appears under certain use cases) --> Josh
  - Voice, tone, and style (does it comply with vets.gov style guide?) --> SO Company

 - [ ] Document needs (including IA) (e.g., highlight which parts will not be needed in future, which need revision, and which do not need revision) --> Josh/Suzanne/Mel
  - Note: this might be best delivered to content team in the form of an annotated wireframe
