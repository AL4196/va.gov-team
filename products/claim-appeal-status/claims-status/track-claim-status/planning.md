# UX Claim Status Planning -- v.2 expansion to more claim types

## Some info
- focus of expansion:
- on differences
  - ebenefits only has one set of templates that are used across all claim types so for this iteration that's what we'll do too -- but there's an opportunity in the future to do customizations for each claim type.
  - claim type attribute in the summary page in ebenefits shows different labels used for the different claim types. 
    - for some types, a Veteran can apply for multiple and it would be considered a "dual claim" resulting in a claim label like "compensation and pension"
    - some may or may not have a decision rating at the end

## Tasks (to be organized)
- [ ] Discovery about other claim types (with Josh)
- [ ] Review old "v.2" list
- [ ] Review all current screens for language that would need to change to accomodate new claim types (did we use any disability compensation specific language?)
- [ ] Incorporate design/content adjustments that were put on hold until after initial release
- [ ] Review static vets.gov content about new claim types, investigate new needs, and make recommendations to content team
