### eBenefits
- would look for dashboard to see status
- When looking at Claims status process
	- "This doesn't tell you how long it takes"
	- Previous screen says "Gathering evidence" but it should have a partial shading or something that shows where user's claim is on it.
	- "I want to see where me, my stuff is in the process"

### Vets.gov claims 

Likes the checkmarks. 
Understands the functions of accordians
Like that there are given dates "that way I know that I'm not waiting of me or on someone else"
- Looks when she received something
- When I go to get my DD214 - expect to see change when I go to my appointment.
- "We live in an electronic age, I know know why it should take 6 months"
- This is more straightforward, easy to see. This one gives me a timeline. This one also gives me a visual -- the green checks are helpful. 
- Didn't notice number of steps. Assumes that there are still 8 steps, just consolidated. 
- Prefers this one because of dates and timeline "I don't have to hunt it down."
- Assumes that Tinnitus, Arthritis, PTSD are 3 different claims. Are all of the answers for 3 different claims going to be in one place?
- Don't know if the application is going to get 1 decision or 14 decisions.

### Estimated date 
- Prefers to see an estimated date
Expects to be done after that date. 
- Trust B the most. Good proximation. 
- Seeing # of days requires a calcutor

### Log in
- Pain point: always having to change passwords
- Would pick DS log on because facebook is not secure 
- Compares it to social security
- (At photo uploading section)For me in 20 years, this process is going to be very aggravating. This is frustrating for those who are not tech savvy. 
- "And all of this is to refill a Rx? Pharmacy doesn't even ask for this"
- "Why do you need my social? Y'all should have this, right?"
- "It was a lot of clicking going on, and asked for my personal information, and required me to be in front of a computer and have a phone... I think there should be an easier way..."
- "I would think that you should already have my information in the system"
- I already have my eBenefits log in, another log in, now I have to log into ID.me? I'm already in the system.

### eBenefits

- "It explains why it's so damnn complicated to get anything done"
- We just don't know what step we are at. 

### Vets.gov
- "At least it let's us know what they need from us"
- It let's you know what's going on and makes you be proactive. 
- It's more detailed and walks your thought what you're looking for. 

### Step 5
- Choice A, I would know what to look forward to (most clear) (trust most but I know it being an exact date is obviously not true).
- B requires to look on calculator (least clear)
- C requires calculation

### Log on 

- Would choose google a by now.ccount, "less chances of being hacked."
- Trusts tests because it has ID.me and familiar words in URL
- What happens if your address on your ID doesn't match the address you live in now? e.g. updating driveres liscense in another city
	- Thinks the ID is the correct email. 
- "Yay I've been verified."
- You verfied my email 3x
- Confirmation code -- whose phone? 
- "Do we need a check list of how many times or when you need to be verified again?
Do I have to do this multiple times? If it's one time, that's fine."

## P3

- Participants Wisconsin Claim never went anywhere
- didn't know about service officers (VSO) to help with claimers
- Have been working on this since 2005
- Tried DS log on and couldn't get in because user doesn't have a CAT card

### eBenefits

- Looks like there is information that is needed
- Expects colors of claim status process to change color
- VSO said what she needed and she filed everything I gave her. 
- Never saw the process in this manner
- This would be a lot of good information 
- Valuable if user could "help" the process so things can go a little quicker

Vets.gov call out box is not prominent enough for users to find. 

### Vets.gov

- Wants to see boxes to be clickable
- Comparable with eBenefits and finds it to be the same thing
- Suggestion Mar 2017 (giving a month)
- Prefers horizontal progress
- Would be really angry knowing that the claim is ready way after the dates estimated
- Just listening to older Vets and some of the new Vets, they've been told they'll be getting their calim back but it doesn't work that way.

### Log on

- VA already have all of my information -- don't like having to share it again through a 3rd party. I don't care who that 3rd party is. I am never going to register for them. 
- "I don't know who they are going to sell this information too"
- Give it a little more life and colors
- http://vetfriends.com/
- legion.org
- "Give us color"
