# Claim Status Usability Testing

## Purpose
- For Veterans to be able to find and easily understand:
 - What's going on now?
 - How long will it take?
 - What happens next?
 - What do I need to do?
- The purpose of each usability session is to explore:
 - baseline test using ebenefits claim status
 - which navigation option works better
 - which status/activity design works better
 - are the labels and text clear?

### Methods:
- Usability testing
- Evaluate time-on-task
- Since we’ll be looking at 2 ebenefits and new prototype, the  order will be alternated to control for ordering bias

### Prototype links

## Script
Thank you for joining us today. My name is [NAME] and we also have [NAME OF OTHERS OBSERVING] observing and taking notes for this session. We are doing this website feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs working to build a new website that will help veterans get easier access to the benefits they deserve.

The team wants to evaluate a draft version of a website today. We want to see what works well, and what doesn’t work well. We're going to show you a few versions of the website. Not everything is working quite yet, so if you click on something and it doesn't work - just tell me what you would have expected to happen.

In this session, I’ll ask you to look at the sites with me, and give you time to freely explore and have you show me how you would use the sites on your own. This will help us better understand how to make the site as easy to use and helpful as possible.

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work.
* We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
* This entire usability test session should take about 40 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.
* We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site. Recording our discussion today will help us capture everything you say accurately.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop, and you will still recieve your $25 thank you.
* As we're going through the session, I'd like you to think out loud.... [demonstrate]
* Do you have any questions at this stage?
* [The moderator reviews consent form with participant.]
* Do you have any questions before we get started?
* [The moderator will begin audio and screen recording, if using.]

### Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)
Before we look at the websites, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- Can you tell me about yourself? (When did you serve, what branch, job, rank, deployments, discharge, etc.)
- Tell me about your experience filing a claim. How did it go? 
- What worked well? What was frustrating?
- How long did it take to process the claim? 
- How did you check the status of the claim while it was happening? How did it go? 

### First impressions of website (5 minutes)
Take a look at this website, and let's say that you were in the middle of applying for a disability claim. I don’t want you to click anything just yet, but just explore the website like you would normally if you just found it. You can scroll if you want to – but again, no clicking. 
- What are your first impressions?
- What do you notice first?
- If you were using this, where would you start?
- Who do you think this information is for?
- How does this make you feel?
- What do you like? What do you dislike?
- (FOR NEW PROTOTYPE ONLY) Without clicking, what do you think is the purpose of the "files" tab? The "Details" tab? What would you expect to find if you clicked on it?
- Where would you want to click first? What would you expect to happen?
- Go ahead and click. Is that what you expected?


Task 1: Check claim status
You submitted a disability compensation claim for multiple conditions back in July (for new, or Aug. for eben)  and you want to check on the progress. Using this website, see what you can learn about what's happening with your claim.

- What would you do first?
- Which stage is it in now? How do you know that?
- What are the steps, and what does each one mean? (If needed, follow up: how do you know when a decision is made?)
- Let's say this was your friend's claim – please explain to me what is going on with his claim.  (for ebenefits this stuff is on hover...)
- Where it is in the overall process?
- When might it be completed?
- What is confusing about this page? 
- What do you have questions about?

Want to learn:
- Do the names of each stage make sense?
- Recent activities?
- How would you see activities from a previous stage?

Task 2: Veteran actions needed
Let's say the VA needed something from you to complete this claim. How would you find out what they need, using this site?

- Go ahead and show me what you need to do, and then try and complete it. 
- How did that go?
- What would you say is the purpose of this page?

Task 2a: For the other items in the list, can you describe why they're listed or how this information might be useful?

Task 2b: [ Go through each of the headers on the page..]
- What do you think... [ Submitted files/Submit Additional Evidence.. etc ] is for? How do you know that?

Task 2c: Based on this page, what documents does the VA already have related to your claim?

Task 3: Claim details
- You'd like to review the basic information about your claim - such as when it was received and who your representative is - to make sure the VA has everything correctly. Where would you click?
- How did that go?
- What is confusing?
- What do you have questions about?

Task 4: Getting help
- Let's say you have a question about your claim (like if something in the details doesn't look correct), what would you do next on this site to get your question answered? Go ahead and show me what you would do, and let me know when you find it. 
- How did that go?
- What is confusing?
- What do you have questions about?


Task 5: Notifications (skip for eBenefits)
- If you wanted to receive a message every time your status changed, how would you do that? Go ahead and show me what you would do, and let me know when you find it. 
- How did that go?
- What is confusing?
- What do you have questions about?

### Follow-up: 
- Overall, what are your general impressions of this website? 
- How informed would you feel about your claim if you had access to this page? Does one of the options we looked at today make you feel more informed than the other?
