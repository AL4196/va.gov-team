## Key Takeaways
### Overview
- Understanding the steps in VA's claims process gives Veterans confidence that their claims are making progress.
- One participant with Parkinson's and memory issues highlighed the importance of our work on accessibility, plain language, and clear design.

### What worked well
#### Status / Timeline
- All of the participants responded positively to the timeline presentation and were able to understand where their claim was in the process
  - "I feel like I have a lot more information on the status. The timeline, listing out the steps - it shows what's happening at each point in time."
  - "gives you more transparency about what the VA process is so I understand and feel my needs are being validated"
  - One thing that would be interesting is seeing who all is reviewing, the bodies it goes to for review and sign off. I feel like it gives you a realistic estimate of how long it will take. If you know it has to be reviewed by 5 different groups, it feels like your claim is making progress rather than being in a black hole for several weeks or months. Feeling like you really have no control over the process.
  
#### Files
- All participants were able to easily tell what's needed from them and by when.
  - "I like the timeline on the files page. Can see when they are due, and they're prioritized. I like that the MPR says "we've requested from others, but if you have it you can send it." If I have it I can speed it up. However I like that it doesn't promise that if I upload it will make the process faster."
  
#### Tabs
- Only one user commented that "details" is a little vague, otherwise users were able to easily navigate with tabs and find what they were looking for.

#### Ask VA to Decide Your Claim
- Most participants understood this feature, didn't struggle with how it's presented (in either ebenefits or vets.gov) but questioned its value. 

#### Notifications
- No issues finding it and multiple positive comments about having this feature
 - "Getting alerts would be great."

#### Help
- All participants found this easily. Some were skeptical about the quality of help they'd receive based on their prior experiences.

### What didn't work well
- Two participants thought that once they submitted the 2 files requested that it would go to the 4th step (but that's not necessarily true)
- Given the questions asked about Ask VA to Decide Your Claim, it may be best to hide/de-emphasize/deactivate this while the VA has requested additional files from the Veteran.
 - "I don't think anyone would click that. If you needed documents which are critical, you want to give them every piece of ammunition you have."
  - "Don't know many people who'd use that. Means I don't have anything else to give you so guess it lets you go ahead and do this. Since VA has a reputation for not being easy, vets wouldn't want to give up option for VA to not ask for additional docs."
- A few very minor issues with sections on files page; team will adjust

### Next steps
- The team is looking into options around how to emphasize "Ask VA to Decide" only at times that are to the Veteran's benefit
- The team will clarify some language around sections on the files page

### Participant Quotes
- "It looks really user friendly"
- "I honestly like this a lot better [than ebenefits]. Where it has the steps and the checkmark, that's perfect... It has everything I can get from the website but it's a lot friendlier...Much better and streamlined."
- "It feels like I have more autonomy/control and I can affect the progress of the claim a bit more than in the past. You're getting so much insight into how information is traveling and all the nodes it's hitting."
- "A lot easier than what they have. There's good things here. Even though there are a lot of people that use computers now, making them simple like they do for us seniors - it needs to be spelled out and simple to work. It doesn't need to be a complicated process. This is so far so good."
- "Very informed. Looking from the outside, is there as much information on the screen when I look at it? No. But if I can take a quick glance and understand it, that's good. I see exactly where I'm at. I think adding more stuff into this is gonna take away from it."
- "This is where it's at. Once I saw this, I'd go out of my way not to go to the desktop site. Honestly that's the best thing you can hope for. If I was at work and couldn't get wifi I'd try to cheat it and try to get on the mobile site with my phone. It's streamlined, there's no nonsense in there. Doesn't have as much word vomit for describing each and every thing."
