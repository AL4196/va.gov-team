## Claims Status
- Overall, this went well.
  - Participants liked seeing ways they can help the claim, "things I can do to make it go faster"
- We didn't see confusion about difference between 5-8 steps, but most participants were not familiar with original 8 phases
 - Challenge: one participant preferred the eBenefits version, because it had more details about what happens in each step. This content is in progress for vets.gov.
- For estimated claim completion, 3/3 prefer to see option (A) date estimate.
 - “Don’t make me get a calculator to figure out when that is.”
 - Question: if I submit three different claims, will I get one decision all at once or more?

## Login
- New intoduction language has helped to set expectations, though some frustrations remain
 - There were more steps than expected, and some seemed like repeats
 - 2-factor is confusing to those not familiar - "why do you need my phone number for the 4th time?" Can we default to the one they used to get a code before, and/or explain 2-factor a little more.
 - An overview of the process, and showing where they are in the steps may be helpful
 - Unclear whether they have to do this whole thing every time, vs 2-factor every time
- Some don’t want to do a 3rd party site, “give VA info they have,” prove identity again and again - they may not use Vets.gov
 - Expectation: DS logon should bypass some of this
 - Why do you need my full social? Isn't the last four enough?
 - Social logons: what will be shown in the final version? We again heard low trust for Facebook.
- Next steps: since this was a small group of participants, we'd like to have our content expert take a pass at the language rather than request any immediate changes.
