## Conversation Guide

### Introduction
Thank you for joining us today. My name is [NAME] and we also have [NAME OF OTHERS OBSERVING] observing and taking notes for this session. We are doing this website feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs working to build a new website that will help veterans get easier access to the benefits they deserve.

The team wants to evaluate a draft version of a website today. We want to see what works well, and what doesn’t work well. We're going to show you a few versions of the website. Not everything is working quite yet, so if you can tell us what you expect to do on each screen before you do it we can help you through any rough patches. We are especially insterested in places where you don't know how you should answer a question.

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work.
* We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
* This entire usability test session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.
* We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site. Recording our discussion today will help us capture everything you say accurately.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop, and you will still recieve your $25 thank you.
* As we're going through the session, I'd like you to think out loud.... [demonstrate]
* Do you have any questions at this stage?
* [The moderator reviews consent form with participant.]
* Do you have any questions before we get started?
* [The moderator will begin audio and screen recording, if using.]


### Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)
Before we get started, I'd like to ask you a few warm-up questions.
- Can you tell me about yourself? (When did you serve, what branch, job, rank, deployments, discharge, etc.)
- Have you used or applied for any VA benefits?
- Can you tell me about your experience applying for those? How did it go? 
- What went well? What was difficult or confusing?


### ebenefits
Let's pretend you started your application for benefits about two months ago, and you want to check on its status. I'm going to share my screen and pass over control to you.
- Can you take a look and describe what stage of the process your application is in?
- What will the next step be? How many more steps does it have to get through?
- (If needed, guide them to the 8 steps)
- Have you seen these steps of the process before? What do you think of them?
- I'd like to head back the page we were just on for a minute... (Navigate them back to prior page)

### vets.gov
It looks like there's a new way to see your application status up at the top there - what do you think you might see if you were to click on that?
- (encourage to click if needed) What are your first impressions of this?
- Can you take a look and describe what stage of the process your application is in?
- What's next after this? How many other stages does it have to go through?
- What do you think of these steps of the process?
- (if needed) Did you notice that on the first site there were 8 steps, and in the new site there were 5? What do you think about that difference? (follow up) Does either make more sense to you? Why?
- Of the two ways to see where your application is in the process, which would you rather see? Why?

### New flow - getting help
- Let's say you have a question about your claim (like if something in the details doesn't look correct), what would you do next on this site to get your question answered? Go ahead and show me what you would do, and let me know when you find it.
- How did that go?
- What is confusing?
- What do you have questions about?

### Completion data options, scenario one (2 months in, 5 months left)
- Let's take a look of a few ways the VA might show you something about your claim.
_for each option_
- What does this tell you about your claim?
- When do you think it'll actually be done?
- Which will be done soonest?
- Which is most clear? What makes it clear?
- Which do you trust the most? Least? Why?

### Completion data options, scenario two (4 months in, 3 months left)
Okay, let's say two months just passed since you checked on your claim, so you first filed your claim about 6 months ago. Let's take a look at some ways that the VA could tell you about how long it might take.
_for each option_
- What does this tell you about your claim?
- When do you think it'll actually be done?
- Which will be done soonest?
- Which is most clear? What makes it clear?
- Which do you trust the most? Least? Why?
- Is there anything that could be better with what we've just looked at?

### Logon 
I'd like to switch topics for a couple of minutes...
- TASK: Let's say you wanted to check on your VA prescriptions. Can you show me how you would do that?

 - What are your first impressions of this page? 
 - What would you want to click first? 
 - Go ahead and show me what you would do next. 
 
 
**After completing flow**
 - How easy or hard is it to fill a prescription on this website?
 - What, if anyhing, is confusing or unclear?
 - How did that go? Were there parts of the process that were confusing or difficult?
 - If you wanted to explain the new account and how to get it to a friend who hadn't done that yet, what would you tell them?

### Wrap-up
Thank participant for their time, ask if they have other friends who might be interested in participating in sessions, make sure we have contact info for renumeration. 
- How would they like their $25 thank-you gift: Amazon, PayPal, or Venmo? Same contact info as we have?
