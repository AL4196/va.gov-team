# Claim Status Tool: Research plan

This doc outlines our research needs for the Claim Status Tool. 
By Christian Valla

## Project background

The Claim Status Tool was launched approximately 3 years ago and only minor changes have been done since. The claim status tool is a priority to improve, as it is used frequently by millions of veterans (it is not uncommon for veterans to check their claim status several times a week). We see this as an opportunity to create a great user experience for veterans using and depending on this tool.
Very little research has been done on the claim status tool. What has been done is shared here:  [research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/claim-appeal-status)

## Product questions

Learn more about: 
- What research and recommendations already exist?
- What can be learned from other companies and organizations about claim / status tracking and tracking tools?
- What expectations do users have towards tracking tools in general?
- What are the current use cases within the current claim status tool?
- What are the pain points and limitations of the current tool?
- What is working well with the current tool?
- How can the current tool be improved?
- Understand what users need and want from such a tool. What would they like to accomplish within the tool, that they can't accomplish now?


How to create a better Claim Status Tool:
- How can the claim status tool be redefined, to create a better experience?
- Investigate how the new claims tool can be pushed further, and look for not only better user experiences, but potentially broaden the scope and possibilities of such a tool. Could the new tool expedite additional use cases?
- Investigate how this tool can integrate with other parts of VA.gov, especially with regards to the revamp of the content pages (communicate with Liz Lantz).
- Understand how the new claim status tool can best expedite the relevant use cases in an efficient and elegant way.


## Research needs

We would like to propose a research process consisting of 5 steps:

1. A previous research review, including a detailed mapping of the current tool and its use cases, as well as any existing quantitative and qualitative research.
2. A comparative analysis to learn how other organizations and companies are handling status (claim) tracking.
3. Quantitative analysis of the current claim status tool data. 
4. Usability test of the existing claim status tool (if applicable, include early concepts to test).
5. Concept testing and usability testing of the new claim status tool.


### 1. Previous research review

Approximately 2-3 days of work

We'd like to go through all previous, relevant qualitative and quantitative research, to learn from it and make sure we are not duplicating research.                                 
Previous research: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/claim-appeal-status
  
### 2. Comparative analysis of status tracking tools

Approximately 2-3 days of work

We want to understand better what a claim status tool can be, new possibilities for good user experiences, and possible new business opportunities. We will do a comparative analysis, learn about how other companies and organizations and handle claims, status tracking, progress updates etc. 



### 3. Quantitative analysis

Approximately 2-3 days of work

Investigate data such as:

- How many claims, on average, does a user have within the claim status tool?
- What call center data can we collect for the claim status tool? What were people calling in about?
- What are the most prevalent types of documents uploaded in the 'additional evidence' tool?
- When users exit the CST, where do they go?
- How do users enter the CST? What page(s) do they come from?



### 4. Usability test of current claim status tool

Approximately 6-7 days of work

- What are the use cases for the current claims tool?
- What expectations do users have for the claims tool?
- How is the current tool meeting these expectations?
- What are the usability issues and pain points?
- What would make the tool more useful?
- What is working well with the current tool?
- What are the needs and wants that users have, that are not being met by the current tool?


### 5. Concept testing and usability testing new claim status tool

Approximately 7 days of work

- Test early concepts of a new claim status tool.
What is working and what is not?
What other opportunities lie within this tool?
- Usability testing of the new claim status tool.



## Methods

- Previous research review
- Competitive analysis
- Quantitative analysis
- Usability test (remote, zoom)
- Concept test (remote, zoom)
- Usability test (remote, zoom)



## Next steps

- Complete a previous research / work review.
- Complete a comparative analysis.
- Do a quantitative analysis
- Recruit participants for usability study of current tools. (- Make sure the claim status tool can be tested in staging. (?))
- Create a conversation guide/script for the usability test of the current tool.
- Execute usability study of current tools.
- Recruit participants for concept testing of new tool ideas.
- Create prototype for new claims tool.
- Write a conversation guide for concept testing.
- Concept testing of new claim status tool.
- Recruit participants for usability study of new claims tools.
- Create prototype and conversation guide.
- Conduct a usability test of new claims tools.
- Synthesize research


## Research synthesis

- A report that summarizes the Previous Research Review and the Competitive analysis.
- A report from any quantitative analysis.
- A report from the usability test of the current claim status tool.
- A report from early concept testing of new claim status tool sketches / ideas.
- A report from the usability test of a new claim status tool.
- An executive summary from all research.
