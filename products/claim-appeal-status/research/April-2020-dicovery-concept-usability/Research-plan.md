# Claim Status Tool: Research plan

This doc outlines our research/discovery needs for the new Claim Status Tool. 
By Christian Valla

## Project background

The Claim Status Tool was launched approximately 3 years ago and only minor changes has been done since then. This tool is a priority to improve as it is used frequently by millions of veterans. (It is not uncommon for veterans to check their claim status several times a week.) We see this as an opportunity to create a great user experience for veterans using and depending on this tool. 

Very little research has been done on the claim status tool. What has been done is shared here: [research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/claim-appeal-status)

## Product questions

Learn more about: 
- What research and recommendations already exists?
- What can be learned from other companies and organizations about claim status tracking and tools? 
- Learn more about user expectations towards tracking tools in general.
- What are the current use cases within the current claim status tool?
- What are the painpoints and limitations of the current tool? 
- What are working well with the current tool? 
- How can the current tool be improved? 
- Understand what users needs and wants from such a tool. What would they like to accomplish within the tool, that they can't accomplish now?  

How to create a better Claim Status Tool:
- How can the claim status tool be redefined, to create a better and more efficient experience? 
- Investigate how the new claims tool can be pushed further, and open up for not only better user experiences, but potentially broaden the scope and possibilities of such a tool. Could the new tool expedite additional use cases? 
- Investigate how this tool can integrate with other parts of VA.gov, especially with regards to the revamp of the content pages (communicate with Liz Lantz). 
- Understand how the new claim status tool can best take care of the most common use cases in an efficient and elegant way.


## Research needs

We would like to propose a research process consiting of 4 phases:

1. Previous work review, including a detailed mapping of the current tool/flow.
2. A discovery phase, to better define user behavior, expectations, and needs, including a comparative study looking into hoe other companies / organizations are dealing with (claim) status tracking. 
3. Usability test of excisting claim status tool (if applicable: include early concepts to test).
4. Concept testing and usability testing of the new claim status tool. 

### 1. Previous research review

We'd like to go through all previous research on the claim status tool, to learn from it and make sure we are not duplicating any research. 
Are there any existing, relevant quantitative research?
  
### 2. Discovery phase

We want to understand better what a claim status tool can be, what the possibilities are for good user experiences, and what business opportunities are here. We will start with a competitive analyses and see how other companies and organizations and handling claims, status tracking, progress info etc.

### 3. Usability test of the current claim status tool

- Why are users coming to the claim status tool? 
- What are the most frequent use cases?
- What expectations do users have to the tool? How is the tool meeting these expectations?
- What are the usability issues and pain points?
- What would make the tool more useful?
- What is working well with the current tool?
- What are the needs and wants that users have that are not being met by the current tool?


### 4. Concept testing and usability testing of new claim status tool

- Test early concept of a new claim status tool. 
- Usability test of new claim status tool. 



#### Tasks
