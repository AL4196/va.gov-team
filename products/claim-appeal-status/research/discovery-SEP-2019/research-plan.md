# Research Plan for Unicorns, Claim Status Tool, September 2019

## Goals
- The primary goal of this research is to understand how and why Veterans are using the Claim Status tool to submit their Decision Review forms. 
- The secondary goal is to understand how Veterans are using the Claim Staus tool and discover opportunities to improve their experiences.

### Background
Veterans are using the Claim Status tool to submit their Decision Review forms. This creates a problem because the forms get stored in the eFolder, without an EP code for tracking and does not notify anyone of their existence. Therefore, Decision Review form could go unnoticed indefinitely. This issue was identified during a conversation with RVSR (rater inside VA).

### Research questions
- Where would Veterans expect to be able to submit Decision Review forms?
- Why and how are Veterans using the Claim Status tool to submit Decision Review forms?
- What do Veterans expect to happen after the submit the Decision Review form through the tool?
- How are Veterans are using the Claim Staus tool? 
  - How do they feel about it? 
  - Does it have the information that Veterans need?
  - Is the information clear and easy to understand?

### Hypotheses
- Veterans are using the Claim Status tool to submit Design Review forms because there isn't a better way to submit them on VA.gov.
- There are opportunities to improve the Claim Status tool and appeals content on VA.gov to help Veterans easily understand the process. 

## Method
- We are identifying how many Veterans are submitting Decision Review forms on the Claim Status tool by identifying the number of documents in the eFolder that have:
  - form numbers (20-0095, 20-0096)
  - no EP codes

- We are identifying the volume of calls to the Call Center about submitting Decision Reviews on VA.gov.

- We are using remote, moderated usability studies because we need to talk to Veterans who may try or have tried to submit Decision Review forms through the Claim Status tool. 

- We will use Zoom to conduct these sessions.
  
- We will ask Veterans to log in to VA.gov and share their screens with us via Zoom. 


## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact UX lead.)

## When? 
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours) 

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 

## Team Roles
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 
- Moderator:
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):
- Participant recruiting & screening:
- Project point of contact:
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Note-takers:
- Observers:

**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**
