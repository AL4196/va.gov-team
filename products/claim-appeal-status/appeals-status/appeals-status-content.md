# Appeals Status
You have the right to appeal any benefits decision made by the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). The VA appeals process is set in law and is different from other judicial appeals processes. Find out how to file an appeal.

**Have you already filed an appeal?**

When the VBA Regional Office (RO) receives your Notice of Disagreement (NOD), you'll be able to check the status of your appeal on Vets.gov.

Track Your Appeal

## Appeals Process Overview

After VBA has made a decision on your claim, if you disagree with the outcome, you can file an appeal for some or all of the issues you were seeking benefits for in your claim.

**The process has many steps that can repeat themselves.** At any time in the process, VA can issue a decision on part or all of your appeal, but in general an appeal follows these steps:

### File a Notice of Disagreement (NOD)

By filing an NOD, you begin the appeals process. You'll need to file an NOD within 1 year from the date on the letter letting you know of the decision on your claim.  [Download a Notice of Disagreement (Form 21-0958)]( https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0958-ARE.pdf).

Fill out your NOD and mail it to the address provided on the VA claim decision notice letter you received, or bring it to your local RO.

### RO prepares the Statement of the Case (SOC)

After you file your NOD, if the RO can’t grant all or part of your appeal, it will prepare the SOC for the issues in your appeal that were not granted. To do this, they review all the evidence related to your appeal, including any new evidence you submit. You'll receive a copy of it in the mail.

### Submit a Form 9

When you receive a copy of the SOC in the mail, you’ll also receive a Form 9. If you disagree with the SOC and want to continue the appeal process, you must return Form 9 within 60 days. This step is also called filing a Substantive Appeal.

### (Optional) RO prepares the Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC)

You can submit new evidence for your appeal at any time in the process. Each time you do, the RO will need to make a decision or prepare an SSOC if the RO can’t grant all or part of your appeal. This may add time to your appeal, but may make your appeal more successful if the evidence supports your argument. This step can happen at any time after the RO prepares the SOC.

### RO certifies your appeal to the Board

The RO will prepare your appeal and send it to the Board for review. Your appeal will wait in line until the Board is able to review it.

### The Board activates your appeal

The Board now has control of your appeal. Lawyers who are experts in Veterans law and reviewing benefit claims will review it. The review prepares your appeal for a Veterans Law Judge who will make a decision. In most cases, your appeal is reviewed in the order it was received. In some cases, an appeal will be moved to the front of the line—this happens if you’re facing severe financial hardship, over age 75, or have a serious illness.

### (Optional) Hearing
If you request a Board hearing, you’ll be sent a letter at least 30 days before it’s scheduled to happen. [Learn more about hearings]().

### The Board makes its decision

The Board has reviewed your appeal and provides a decision on each issue in your appeal. Each issue will be decided in 1 of 3 ways:
- **Allowed:** The Board grants benefits.
- **Remanded:** The Board needs more evidence to make a decision and will return your appeal to VBA. After VBA obtains the additional evidence, it will then make a new decision on the appeal. If VBA can’t grant all or part of your appeal, it will prepare a new SSOC and return the appeal to the Board.
- **Denied:** The Board does not grant benefits

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does an appeal take?

An appeal can take 1 to 7 years to get a final decision. After you file a NOD, you can follow the status of your appeal. [Check your appeal status]().

### Can I submit my appeal and related paperwork online?

No. At this time, all forms, evidence, and other paperwork for your appeal have to be sent through the mail. You'll find the correct mailing address on information sent to you by VA, or you can send it to:

> Chairman (01)  
> Board of Veterans' Appeals  
> PO Box 27063  
> Washington, DC 20038

### Can I submit more evidence (supporting documents) or make a new argument to support my appeal?

Yes. The appeals process has a “continuous open record.” This means you can send in new evidence and/or make new arguments at any point from the beginning to the end of the appeals process. We also follow what's known as a duty to assist policy. This means that we’ll help you get your treatment records you’ve identified and we’ll provide a physical exam if one is needed.  

Each time you present new arguments and add or find new evidence, VBA will make a decision or prepare a new Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC). This can add time to your appeal, but may make your appeal more successful if the evidence supports your argument.

### How do I get a representative to help me?

If you want to, you can choose a representative to help you with your appeal. This person may be a lawyer, a claims agent, or from a Veterans Service Organization (VSO). [Search for an accredited representative](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp).

Once you have a representative, you’ll need to let VA know they have permission to represent you by completing a form.

- If your representative is a lawyer or claims agent, fill out the Appointment of Individual as Claimant's Representative (Form 21-22A). [Download Form 21-22A](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-22A-ARE.pdf).
- If your representative is a VSO, fill out the Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative (Form 21-22). [Download Form 21-22](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-22-ARE.pdf).

### What if I decide I don't want to pursue my appeal anymore?

If at any time you decide you don't want to appeal the claim anymore (for any or all of the issues involved in the appeal), you or your authorized representative can send in a written statement. It should include your name, the related Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a statement that you're withdrawing the appeal.

If you request the withdrawal before you get notice that the appeal has been activated at the Board, send your statement to VBA. After the appeal has been transferred to the Board, you should send it directly to the Board at:

> Chairman (01)  
> Board of Veterans' Appeals  
> PO Box 27063  
> Washington, DC 20038

### What if I decide I don't want a Board hearing anymore?

If at any time you decide you don't want a Board hearing, you or your authorized representative can send in a written statement. Your statement should include your name, the related Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a statement that you're withdrawing the appeal.
Send your letter to:

> Director, Office of Management, Planning and Analysis (014)   
> Board of Veterans' Appeals  
> PO Box 27063  
> Washington, DC 20038

### What happens if the Board makes a final decision and I disagree with it?

You can:
- File a new claim with your RO, or
- File a motion asking the Board to reconsider your appeal (there's no time limit to file this motion), or
- File a motion asking the Board to review your appeal again because there was clear and unmistakable error in its decision (there's no time limit to file this motion), or
- File a Notice of Appeal with the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) within 120 days from the date of the decision by the Board (stamped on the first page of the decision). [Learn how to file an appeal with the CAVC](https://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/appeal.php).

### What is the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC)?

The CAVC is made up of:
- 7 permanent (long-term), active judges, and
- 2 more judges as part of a temporary expansion clause
The CAVC has the sole power to accept or overturn Board decisions and is part of the United States Judiciary, not the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The CAVC reviews Board decisions based on what was in your file at the time the Board reviewed it, and written and oral arguments you or your representative submitted.

The CAVC’s main office is in Washington, DC, but the CAVC holds sessions in other parts of the country a few times each year.

### How do I file a Notice of Appeal with the CAVC?

If the Board has sent you a final decision on your appeal, you can appeal the Board's decision to the CAVC. You’ll need to wait until you have a final decision from the Board—not the VBA RO—before you can appeal to the CAVC. [Learn how to file an appeal with the CAVC](https://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/appeal.php).

# Appeal Hearings at the Board

Hearings are an optional part of the appeals process. They may add time to your appeal, but if you feel that you need to speak to a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) about your appeal, the added time may be worthwhile.

## What happens in a hearing?

During a hearing, you’ll present your information to a VLJ who has reviewed your appeal file. Hearings aren’t as formal as regular court hearings, but you do provide your testimony under oath, and you can bring a representative with you.

You or your representative can tell the VLJ why you think you qualify for the benefits. You can also submit new evidence at this time. You may answer clarifying questions from the VLJ.

The VLJ doesn’t make a decision at the hearing. A transcript of your hearing is created and added to your appeal file. You’ll be asked in your hearing if you’d like a copy of the transcript for your personal records.

There’s no set amount of time for your hearing. Usually hearings last about 30 minutes, but your hearing will last as long as you need to discuss your appeal with the VLJ.

## How do I get a representative?

At your hearing you can bring a representative with you. This person can help you prepare for the hearing and present your information to the VLJ. This person may be a lawyer, a claims agent, or from a Veterans Service Organization (VSO). [Search for an accredited representative](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp). 

Once you have a representative, you will need to let the VA know they have permission to represent you by completing a form. 
 - If your representative is a lawyer or claims agent, fill out the [Appointment of Individual As Claimant's Representative Form](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-22A-ARE.pdf).
 - If your representative is a VSO, fill out the [Appointment of Veterans Service Organization As Claimant's Representative Form](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-22-ARE.pdf).

## How do I ask for a hearing?

You can request a hearing at any time in the appeal process. 

Veterans who ask to have a hearing usually make the request when completing a Form 9. A Form 9 asks you to choose to:
 - Not have a hearing — you have the option to send a letter with what you would like to say to the Board
 - Have a videoconference hearing at your local VA office (or another VA facility selected by the VA) — on average, video hearings are faster to get than in-person hearings
 - Have an in-person hearing at the Board in Washington, DC 
 - Have an in-person hearing at your local VA office — this will add a significant amount of time to your appeal as the Travel Board has a limited schedule

You can also contact your VSO for help requesting a hearing. 

## When will I have my hearing?

It depends on what type of hearing you ask for—for example, video hearings will likely be scheduled much sooner than one with the Travel Board. 

You’ll receive a notice in the mail at least 30 days before your hearing is scheduled. It’s best to not send new evidence after you get this notice. You can bring any new evidence with you to your hearing.


## What if I have to reschedule my hearing?

### Rescheduling In-Person Hearings at the Board in Washington, DC

If you asked for an in-person hearing at the Board, you can send a written request to reschedule your hearing at least 2 weeks before the scheduled hearing date. 

**If your hearing has already been rescheduled before, or you are within 2 weeks of the scheduled hearing date**, you must file a motion requesting that the hearing be rescheduled. You can do this by sending a letter that explains you have "good cause" to reschedule. "Good cause" includes reasons like you, your representative, or a witness were sick, or you had difficulty getting records needed for your appeal. A VLJ will review your motion and decide if the hearing can be rescheduled. You will get a copy of the decision about rescheduling your hearing the mail.

### Rescheduling Travel Board or Videoconference Hearings

If you asked for a Travel Board or videoconference hearing with the Board, you must file a motion requesting that the hearing be rescheduled. This needs to happen at least 2 weeks before the scheduled hearing date. You can do this by sending a letter that explains you have "good cause" to reschedule. "Good cause" includes reasons like you, your representative, or a witness were sick, or you had difficulty getting records needed for your appeal. A VLJ will review your motion and decide if the hearing can be rescheduled. You will get a copy of the decision about rescheduling your hearing the mail. 

If you were planning to have your hearing at a local VA office, please let them know as well.

**Any request to reschedule must be in writing and be mailed to:**

> Director, Office of Management, Planning and Analysis (014)  
> Board of Veterans' Appeals  
> P.O. Box 27063  
> Washington, DC 20038

If you are able to reschedule your hearing, you will receive a notice at least 30 days before the new hearing date.

## What if I have to cancel my hearing? 
If you need to cancel your hearing, please send a letter to the Board at least 2 weeks before your hearing, so the VLJ can hear another appeal at that time. The VLJ will make a decision based on the information you have provided in your appeal.

**Send the letter to:**

> Director, Office of Management, Planning and Analysis (014)  
> Board of Veterans' Appeals  
> P.O. Box 27063  
> Washington, DC 20038

If you were planning to have your hearing at a local VA office, please let them know as well.

- **If your Form 9 was received on or after February 2, 2013:** If you or your legal representative add new evidence, the evidence will be reviewed only by the Board and not by the RO. If someone other than you or your representative submits evidence, the Board will have to remand the appeal to the RO to consider the evidence. The RO will then either make a decision or, if some or all issues in your appeal can’t be granted, will prepare and send you a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC). Sending the case back to the RO for this type of consideration can add years to the time it takes to decide your appeal, but you can avoid this additional delay if you send a letter to the Board that says you want the Board to consider the new evidence without sending it back to the RO.

----------

## Your Appeal Has Been Remanded
**Mar 28, 2018**

The Board has made a decision on each issue within your appeal, and all or some of the issues have been remanded. This means the Veterans Law Judge who reviewed your appeal needs more information before making a decision on all or some of the issues.

On average, about 62% of issues in appeals get remanded. The Board has sent your appeal to the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) to add any relevant information to your case. If a physical exam was requested, VBA will reach out to you. If your appeal is not granted during the VBA review, a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) will be developed and sent to the Board. You’ll also receive a copy of the SSOC in the mail. 

**On average, Veterans with appeals in the Remand stage wait about 14 months for VBA to complete the necessary action.**

----------

## You Have Withdrawn Your Appeal
**May 29, 2017**

Your appeal was withdrawn (canceled) by you or your representative. Your appeal is now closed.

[Learn more about the appeals process]().

----------

## Your Appeal Has Been Merged with Your Earlier Appeal
**Mar 28, 2018**

Because you had separate appeals on multiple claims, the appeals have been merged so that all the issues you appealed can be considered at the same time. Instead of waiting on 2 (or more) decisions, all the issues in your appeals will be addressed in a single decision by the Board. Your place in line is based on your oldest appeal. This means the issues from your newer appeal(s) will be decided more quickly than if the appeals were not merged.

[Learn more about the appeals process]().

----------

## The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) Has Made a Decision
**Jun 21, 2018**

The CAVC has made a decision on your appeal. You’ll receive a copy of the CAVC's decision in the mail.
- If the CAVC denied your appeal, your appeal is now closed.
- If the CAVC reversed the Board decision and granted your appeal, the Board will issue a decision following the CAVC's instructions to grant you the benefits you sought on appeal.
- If the CAVC remanded your case, that means the Board needs to further review your case. The Board will review the CAVC's decision and gather more evidence or make a new decision on your appeal. After a CAVC remand, your appeal has priority status at the Board. There is no average time for this step. The Board will send you a letter when it receives your appeal, and will let you know how to submit any additional evidence you may have. If you have additional evidence for the Board to review, you can submit it within 90 days from the date of the Board's letter.
