## V1:Complete 
[Charter here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/appeals-status/appeals-charter-signed.pdf)

- Type of Appeal: Compensation 
- View past activity dates of appeal 
- show future date for form 9 due
- appeals process page
- appeals hearings page
- show if you scheduled a hearing and what type

Future Ideas: 

- Iteration on hearings page to include wait times for hearings static content page [small, content and front end only]
  - As a user I know how long each type of hearing takes

- Ability to view past statuses (click and view previous activity dates/statuses) [Small, front end only]
  - As a user, when I visit the previous activity section of my appeal I can click and see what those statuses mean

- File an NOD on Vets.gov–NOD starts the entire appeals process [Large]
  - As a user I can file my NOD on Vets.gov 

- Submit form 9 online on Vets.gov–Form 9 basically is the way a Veteran can say, yes I do want to continue with the appeals process.  Veterans have to get it back to the VA within 60 days of receiveing it in the mail. [Large]
  - As a user I can file my form 9 on Vets.gov

- Seeing address [Medium] /editing address [Large, possible V3]
  - As a user I can see/know what address the VA is using to mail all of the important paperwork/forms/decisions related to my appeal. 
  - As a user I can edit my address if the VA is using the wrong address or if I have moved. 

- Include all other types of appeals [TBD, would require API changes but shouldn't be a hard thing to do]
  - As a user, I can see my appeals status for pension, education,etc. not just disability 

- Email alerts/notifications (TBD, need time estimate from appeals team) [TBD, would require API changes]
  - As a user, I can receive an email or text notification that my appeal status has changed. 

- Ability to link a closed, remanded appeal to the new open, post-remand appeal [TBD, would require API changes]
  - As a user I can tell that my closed, remanded appeal was actually reopened as a new appeal 

- View submitted forms online [Large]
  - Potentially starting with SOC or Testimony of Board Hearings
    - As a user I can see  what information I submitted on the forms 

- Showing docket order [Medium] Would require a lot of research, discovery 
  - As a user I can see what docket number I have
