# Vets.gov Product Management Checklist

This is a set of actions for product teams to complete both prior to the launch and immediately following launch of a vets.gov product. The goals of the checklist are to 1) ensure product planning and delivery is consistent across products, 2) prevent common issues with what appears to be a production-ready service, and 3) achieve a repeatable process that is improved with lessons learned on an ongoing basis.

This checklist is a living document that is meant to be a set of *minimum* actions to take. Each product team should add additional items as necessary. If any items added are cross-cutting issues, they should be added to this checklist to encourage shared, iterative learning as vets.gov progresses.

The team lead is accountable for ensuring that all tasks are completed on-time and communicating progress / identifying blockers to the Product Manager (Stacey) and team in a timely way. The team lead is responsible for escalation and issue resolution for risks and blockers on these items.  Not all tasks will be completed by vets.gov team members directly--many tasks will be completed by VA stakeholders or team members--but the vets.gov team lead is responsible for confirming that it has happened.

This checklist can go into the `vets.gov-planning` Issues/card for the project and be updated there.
