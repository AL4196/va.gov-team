## Appeals Process 

After the Veterans Benefits Administration makes a decision on your claim, you can appeal some or all of the decision if you disagree with it.
If you want to, you can have a representative help you with your appeal. This person may be a lawyer, claims agent, or Veterans Service Officer.

### An appeal follows these steps:

#### You file a Notice of Disagreement

By filing a Notice of Disagreement, you begin the appeals process. You’ll need to file a Notice of Disagreement within 1 year of the date on the letter notifying you of the claim decision. [Download a Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 21-0958)]().
Fill out your Notice of Disagreement and mail it to the address provided on the VA claim decision notice letter you received, or bring it to your local regional office. A representative can help you file a Notice of Disagreement.

#### The Veterans Benefits Administration sends you Statement of the Case
After you file your Notice of Disagreement, a Decision Review Officer will review all of the evidence related to your appeal, including any new evidence you sent. If the Decision Review Officer determines that there is not enough evidence to fully grant your appeal, they will send you their findings in a document called a Statement of the Case. You can then decide whether to continue your appeal to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals.

#### You return the VA Form 9 
When you receive a copy of the Statement of the Case in the mail, you’ll also get a VA Form 9. If you disagree with the Statement of the Case and want to continue your appeal to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals, you must return VA Form 9 within 60 days. 

#### The Veterans Benefits Administration prepare a Supplemental Statement of the Case (optional)
You can submit new evidence for your appeal at any time in the process. If you submit new evidence after you receive a Statement of the Case, the Decision Review Officer will need to write a Supplemental Statement of the Case before transferring your case to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals. Once your appeal is transferred, new evidence can be sent directly to the Board and will not be reviewed by the Veterans Benefits Administration.

#### Your appeal is sent to the Board
The Decision Review Officer will finish their review and transfer your case to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals. The Board reviews cases in the order they are received as determined by the date of the VA Form 9. A judge will begin work on your appeal when it is among the oldest appeals that are ready for their review.

If you are suffering a serious illness or are in financial distress, or for other sufficient cause, you can apply to have your appeal Advanced on Docket. If you are older than 75, your appeal will receive this status automatically. Advanced on Docket appeals are prioritized so that they are always at the front of the line.

#### You have a hearing (optional)
You have the option to request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge. At your hearing, the judge will ask you questions about your appeal. A transcript of your hearing will be made and added to your appeal file. The judge will not make a decision about your appeal at the hearing.

#### The Board makes its decision

The Board reviews your appeal and provides a decision on each issue in your appeal. The Board decides each issue in 1 of 3 ways:
 • Grant: The judge disagrees with the original decision and decides in your favor.
 • Deny: The judge agrees with the original decision.
 • Remand: The judge sends the issue back to the Veterans Benefits Administration to gather more evidence or to fix a mistake before deciding whether to grant or deny.

**Note:** About **60%** of all decisions have at least 1 issue remanded.

### What if I disagree with the Board’s decision?

If you disagree with the Board’s decision, you can appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. You will need to hire a VA-accredited attorney to represent you, or you may represent yourself. You will need to file your Court appeal 120 days of the Board’s decision.
