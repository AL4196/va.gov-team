#### `ramp_eligible`

**Alert title:**
This appeal is eligible for the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program

**Description:**
On [date], VA sent you a letter informing you of a new program called the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP). The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act will create new options in 2019 for Veterans seeking review of VA decisions. RAMP is a program that allows you to opt in to one of the two new "lanes" for review before the new law takes effect. For more information, review the fact sheet that was enclosed with the letter.

In order to participate, you must return the RAMP Opt-in Election form. If you choose to participate in RAMP, VA will withdraw all of your eligible appeals and instead review your case using the lane you select. If you do not want to participate in RAMP and wish to continue your appeal under the existing process, no action is required.

#### `ramp_ineligible`
**Alert title:**
This appeal is not eligible for the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program

**Description:**
On [date], VA sent you a letter informing you of a new program called the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP). However, this appeal is not eligible to participate in RAMP because it [is closed/is active at the Board of Veterans' Appeals]. If you have other appeals, they may still be eligible to participate in RAMP.


## Style 3: Content below 'What happens next'

After Veterans receive a decision, they can choose to bring their appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. At this point, we don't have the data to track what happens during CAVC until it is remanded back to the Board.
