## Intro statement (3 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! Again this is [moderator's name] and I am here with my colleagues [insert names and roles] and we will be observing your session today. We work with the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs on a website called Vets.gov, and we're excited to talk with you today to get your feedback on the website. We'll be looking at Appeals Status together to better understand what parts are easy to use, and what parts are confusing or difficult.

Before we start, a few intro remarks:

We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.
We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

This entire session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.
I’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site, so that we capture your experience accurately.

If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
Any questions about that?

Now I'll read a statement to you about this session. I’ll ask you to either say that you agree to participate or that you do not agree to participate.

“Your participation in this session is voluntary. You may stop at any time. Things we learn today may be used in reports, shared online, and used in presentations. We will never use your real name in any report. We’re recording the session today to be sure that we capture your opinions and ideas accurately. You will receive no compensation from the U.S. government in exchange for participation in this session.”

Does that all make sense, and do you agree to participate?

Great! Any questions before we get started?
