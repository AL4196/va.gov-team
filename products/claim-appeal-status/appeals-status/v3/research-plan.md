# Research Plan for Appeals Team | Product: Appeal Status V3 | - January 2019

(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.)

## Goals
1. What product & team are you doing this research for? 
    - Appeal Status V3 for the Appeals team.
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?
    - Appeal Status is a tool on VA.gov that Veterans use to track their Board appeal at the Board of Veterans Appeals. Product history can be found in the Appeal Status [repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/claim-appeal-status/appeals-status).

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?
    - Does content about Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) on VA.gov make sense for Veterans looking for a decision review?
    - Can Veterans find relevant AMA content and nagivate to the correct pages? 
    - Do Veterans know where in the process your appeal is in now? (for appeal status)
    - Is there anything in particular that is confusing or unclear?
    - Is there anything in particular you would like to know more about?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?
    - One hypothesis is that Veterans think of of all 3 post-decisional lanes as appeals. VBA's position is that Higher Level Reviews and Supplemental Claims are **not** appeals and that only Board appeals are "appeals."   
    - Another hypothesis is that Veterans need a clear understanding of the distinctions between the different dockets at the Board and their expected timelines.
    - Another hypotheis is that Veterans may not know the distinction between legacy appeal vs new decision review options and where to find AMA information. 

## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning?
    - Usability testing with low- or high-fidelity prototypes in-person moderated

2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?
    - We want to meet with Veterans in-person if possible to walk through either low or high fidelity mocks and talk through any parts that may be confusing or unclear.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research?
- DC metro area in-person preferred first
- remote sessions on join.me if we cannot get enough in-person

4.	What will you be testing? Design pages and content about AMA on VA.gov as well as AMA content on Appeal Status

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
    - 3-5 participants in DC metro area for week 1
    - 5-7 participants in DC metro area for week 2  
    - Veterans who had an appeal
    - Uses a computer or smartphone ocassionally 

2.	What is your recruitment strategy?
    - Will need help from recruiting firm to recruit and schedule participants.

## When?
1.	Timeline: When are you hoping this research will happen?
    - Weeks of January 21 (week 1) and January 28 (week 2) 2019.

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin)
    - Week of January 14.

3.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times. Please request enough dates and time slots. Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.
    - Jan 22-25 (week 1)
    - Jan 28-Feb 1 (week 2) 

4.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?
