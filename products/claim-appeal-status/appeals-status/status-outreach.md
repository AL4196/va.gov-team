# Appeals Status Marketing and Outreach 

## Context
The Appeals team has been doing some research on what kind of questions Veterans are asking about their appeals at the hospital. What kind of questions are being asked? Do they get confused between health and compensation benefits? Is there a benefits rep or officer at the hospital that answers these questions. We wanted to see what those touchpoints are and what kind of information Veterans are receiving. In addition, we want to brainstorm ways we can train front office, social workers, and reps to be our vets.gov claims and appeals status ambassadors. 

## What's happened so far

### Meeting with Patrick  
- Gina and Raven met with Patrick Beck, a representative from VBA to learn how VBA is planning to inform Veterans about their claims and appeal statuses at hospitals. [Meeting notes with Patrick Beck](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-design-research/blob/master/Projects/Appeals%20Status/Outreach/Chat%20with%20Patrick%20Beck.md)
- Gina and Raven will soon shadow either Pat or somebody from his team at the DC VAMC in the near future.

### Team meeting
- On Tuesday, November 7th, some folks from the DSVA team met to talk about what training and outreach may look like
- We may be able to get some help from VEO with prints - Suzchap sent an email to Han Wang. 

## Questions

*How can we* - provide VA employees and representatives in the field (social workers, caseworkers, VSOS, VBA, VHA, community centers) information on how to create a profile on Vets.gov and easily access tools?

*How can we* - get VA employees and representatives in the field to trust the accuracy, effectiveness, and value of our tools so that they can be advocates for Vets.gov?
