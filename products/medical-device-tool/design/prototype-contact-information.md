## Use case - Error handling

### Description 
This design shows an example of how error messages should be displayed in the form's UI for the _Contact information_ screen. <br><br>
Initial focus point depends on the action the user is taking. For example, if a user selects & deselects _Street address line 1_, then the focus would be on _Street address line 2_. The design team needs to double-check with the A11Y team to determine where the focus point would be if a user attempted to proceed to the next screen without completing all required fields. 

### Content
**Note:** The content for this screen contains all error messages. Content still needs to be reviewed by content team.
