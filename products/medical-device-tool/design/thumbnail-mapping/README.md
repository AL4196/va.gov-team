### Outcomes & Feedback
As the design team worked, we uncovered some gaps in our knowledge that we needed answered.

#### Presenting to the team:
- For the sake of consistency and technical simplicity, the team agreed to pursue concepts *without* dashboard-like functionality.
- Discussion was had around whether or not to have more generic content and single ordering form for all devices or to have distinct content pages and ordering forms for each product type.

#### Presenting to the DLC:
- After presenting to the BaM2 team, the designers presented the third thumbnail mapping flow to Kevin Q for feedback. The meeting notes can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/medical-device-tool/meetings/20200114-DALC-thumbnail-mapping-review.md). 

#### Check-in with VSP IA:
- It was recommended by the IA/Content team to split up the current DLC offerings of batteries/accessories and prosthetic socks into distinct pages to preserve information scent and SEO value.
- It was noted that a higher level content page may not be necessary with only two product lines being offered currently, but that this may be added in the future.
- Mikki's and Peggy's initial recommendations can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/medical-device-tool/design/ia-recommendations-v1.png)
  - Follow up conversation in slack:
    - Rebecca: Thank you both for providing us some guidance! I was wondering if that guidance would change if the form was to be made more general to incorporate all DLC product lines (hearing aids, prostheses, (future items)) in a single form? Do you see any pitfalls with pursuing this path?
    - Mikki: We would see the two forms at the bottom of each structure merge into one order form.
    - Rebecca: So if we have a general reorder form, you'd still like to see product specific pages?
    - Mikki: There are 2 options, either we have individual content pages for the different products that converge onto a single order form, or we have a single "medical device" hub that describes the products and links to a single form (similar to structure 3).  It really depends on how much content we want/need to provide around each item.  If we can shore up the content, then we can condense those static pages into a single medical device page that links to a single ordering form.  I've added this as a 4th structure.
