# BAM2 Thumbnail mapping review (Iteration 2)
## Agenda:

#### Attendees: 
Matthew Self, Nick Wygonik, Riley Orr, Rebecca Walsh, Amen Ra, Mahariel Rosario, Lihan Li

#### Background:
Our team, Benefits & Memorials 2, is working on modernizing the digital mechanism Veterans use to order medical devices. Practically, this means working with Veterans to design and launch a new ordering mechanism on the VA.gov platform.

#### Purpose:
The team is meeting today so the designers can present the second iteration of the thumbnail mapping diagram to the greater BAM2 team and gather feedback on the thumbnail mapping's second iteration. The team will review the ordering process flow first and the content page designs second. 

#### Outcomes:
If necessary, the team will incorporate feedback into the thumbnail mapping flows prior to presenting to Kevin Q. on 01/23/2020.  

#### Structure:
- Present the order process thumbnail mapping diagrams (5 min)
- Open discussion about the order process thumbnail mapping diagrams (10 min)
- Present the content page designs (5 min)
- Open discussion about the content page designs (10 min)

## Notes:
**Note:** Additional notes may be added if necessary 

- The team is happy with the overall direction of the flows
- The design team may need to investigate design solutions if the DLC provides us with a large number of additional items that can be added to an order
- Matt liked the addition of the email confirmation screen per Kevin Hoffman's suggestion 
- Nick: potential exploration of a "one button to reorder all previous items" feature that could direct the Veteran to the "review submission" screen (may be post-MVP)
- Matt preferred the content page layout including the accordions and the redirect link for ordering via mail/phone (3rd option)
   - He is interested in making the mail/phone content less prominent than it is if possible 
   - Content can include incentives to not order via mail/phone such as "sign in to save your order in progress" and/or "ordering via phone can take up to 45 minutes" (will need to verify with DLC)

## Remaining questions 
- [ ] Are we going to be able to send email confirmations/tracking numbers?
   - [ ] If yes, are we able to contribute to how that content is written?
- [ ] Are there any accessibility considerations for the preferred content page? 
- [ ] How many "additional items" does the DLC want to include? 
- [ ] What is the fate of the legacy VA.gov OPAL pages?
        
 ## Next Steps
* The design team will incorporate any feedback into the thumbnail mapping and/or content pages
* The design team is meeting with the A11Y team on 01/22/2020 for a design intent check-in, and may need to incorporate feedback 
* The design team will finish incorporating any feedback from the VSP design intent check-in 
* The design team will present the thumbnail mapping to the DLC stakeholder(s) on 01/23/2020
* The design team will sync with the development team to discuss next steps to begin coding 
* The design team will need to sync with Peggy to get her feedback on content page designs
