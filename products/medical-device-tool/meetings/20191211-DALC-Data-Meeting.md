## Agenda: Gathering data from DLC to better understand the Veterans Demographics
- Asked for data regarding the points I emailed. 
- Demographic data for KPIs on the Veterans using DLC services.
- Here is a list of questions I was hoping to be able to gather data on the Veterans. This will help us create an intuitive process for the Veterans
- Total number of Veterans by Age categorized by 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, etc  
- Number of orders per ordering channel. (We may want to talk about how far we would like to go back to see a trend line.)
- Can you track how often a Veteran change their order or items in the order? i.e.- Does the Veteran switch out their hearing aid every 3 year?
- I was also wondering what types of metrics/statistics does the DLC tack regarding products and volume of product? Can we look at the data?

Kevin and I talked about why we would be looking for the data and how it will influence our solutions. 
Kevin did mention that the DLC does not have this level of granularity in their current metrics but would see if he could get the data this information for us.  

We talked about ideas for how to address the many variables of reordering the items. 
- Dr. actions
- Device (Hearing aid) issues
- DLC lack of visibility into changes by different Actors/User/Veterans

We also talked about the value that the DLC bring to the Veterans.
- Spoke about the Veterans statements from the interviews
- Talked about how some vets will not use the easier channels because they prefer to talk to a person.
