# DALC Customer Service Representative Interview<br>
## Agenda:<br>
The moderator will guide the customer service representative through a series of questions.   

#### Attendees: 
Riley Orr, Rebecca Walsh, DALC Customer Service Representative

#### Background:
Our team, Benefits & Memorials 2, is working on modernizing the digital mechanism Veterans use to order medical devices. Practically, this means working with Veterans to design and launch a new ordering mechanism on the VA.gov platform.

#### Purpose:
- Learn more about the pain points customer service reps are hearing about from customers
- Become familiar with the pain points for prosthetic socks customers 

#### Key Takeaways (Riley):
- The customer service rep is a prosthetic socks user (leg), but does not order through the VA. He is planning to in the future. 
- He needs to change his socks multiple times a day as his leg becomes skinnier
- Socks are numbered, with higher numbers equaling thicker socks; 5 is the highest number
- Thread color inside the sock indicates thickness: 1 is yellow, 3 is green, 5 is blue
- He needs to replace is socks every 3-4 months
- He only spends a couple times a week processing prosthetic socks orders
- Receives 3-4 mail orders a week for prosthetic socks
- Estimates 97% of his day is spent on hearing aid supplies through the phone
- If the DLC has an email address on file for a customer, they send out an order confirmation and tracking number
- The DLC receives a lot of calls of customers looking to purchase diabetic/compression socks. They do not carry these socks. 
- Prosthetic socks sizing can change without the veteran realizing, so they can order the incorrect items and need to be redirected to their healthcare provider to take new measurements
- Most complaints received from socks customers: incorrect sizes & requesting a specific brand no longer available
- The DLC services more prosthetic socks for legs than arms
- The customer service reps have not been trained on prosthetic socks orders, so many of those calls are redirected to Jeff
- The DLC receives a dozen or more calls a month from customers who are unable to place orders through eBenefits with some of the issues being incorrect product information or not being in the system 

## Notes:
Note: **Moderator is in bold**

**Can I record this meeting?**<br>
That’s fine

**As a Sock User (if applicable):**<br>

**Tell me about yourself?**<br>
I’ve been with the DLC for four and a half years. Since June 2015. What else?

**What do you do?**<br>
I’m a customer service rep. People call in and order their batteries supplies, domes, wax guards, retention locks, hearing aid cases so they can carry their hearing aids around with them. Really very little to do with prosthetic socks because they’re not really that much of a need. They call in but they also send in this little green card that tells us what size their calf and thigh and I guess that kinda stuff is. That they would need to cover so they could  get compression. Well, actually the only socks we carry are for people with artificial limbs. 

**When Jeff connected us to you, he mentioned you were a socks user. I might have misinterpreted, do you use prosthetic socks yourself?**<br>
Well, right my leg is wrapped with gauze and stuff cuz I had an issue with my lower leg. On my right side I have a prosthetic so I use a size one prosthetic sock and later in the afternoon I use a 3 or a 4 depending on how skinny your leg gets you can go up to a 5. I haven’t really used support hose per say for a little while because I’ve had issues with my right left. They just gave me a circade (sp) which is a wrap you put around your calf for compression. But I used to have close toe socks that went just below my knee for compression. 

**What are some of the biggest challenges that you face with your prosthesis?**<br>
My biggest issue is, well it used to be getting around but I get around pretty well now, It’ll be four years, when I first got it it took time to get used to it. There’s a crack (missed this bit). A week or week before I fell down twice on snow/ice. My foot got stuck underneath a lip on my daughter’s step and it took me down before I could get it out. Before this happened I was klutzy too. 

**You change the socks throughout the day?**<br>
1 has a yellow thread and is thinner, the higher you go up it gets thicker. A 5 is pretty thick. The 3’s… the yellow is 1… the green is 3… and the blue is 5. Threads on the inside of the prosthetic sock. 

**When you do need to make adjustments, what do you have to do?**<br>
Well, my leg fits into a socket on my prosthetic so I take my leg off, put another sock on, put it back on!

**So you just keep socks with you?**<br>
Right, and if it needs adjusted.. now I got my prosthetic through Hangar but next Tuesday I am going over to the amputee clinic at Jewell out in Aurora and see if they need to make any adjustments. See if they need to replace a sleeve that attaches to my thigh. I get a lot of compression so the prosthetic will stay on the leg, so. 

**Do you have any strong preferences for any particular brand or type of sock?**<br>
No, not really. 

**Do you order your socks through the VA?**<br>
I go over to the Jewell clinic out in Aurora. Hangar is where I got my prosthetic from. I usually get them from Hangar but I think I’m gonna start getting them from VA before I know it. 

**You’re eligible?**<br>
I am eligible to receive support hose. I’ve gotten those through VA before. Going over to the amputee clinic I’m sure they’ll put me in the system so I can get socks too. Right now I got them through Hangar. 

**Why did you get them through Hangar?**<br>
They didn’t have anyone over at the Jul clinic that could do anything for me. VA is the one who sent me over there. 

**Is that a claims thing?**<br>
I went to a third party and the VA paid for it, so. I don’t have 5 grand laying around. They told me it cost 5 grand.   They have different plies too. I’m noticing they have 6 ply wool, but they’re going away from wool because it’s too hot in the summer. They have 7 ply, there’s 22 and 24 inch lengths. There’s cotton, prosthetic socks. These say 2, 3, and 5 ply.

**You were saying you had a bigger size, it wasn’t lining up in my mind. You needed a wider sock.**<br>
The space it makes throughout the day needs to be filled

**How often so you need to replace the socks?**<br>
Every 3-4 months. 

**How many do you have in rotation?**<br>
Pretty sure I have 3 of each. 1, 3, and 5.

**Do you have all the same ply?**<br>
1, 3, and 5. 

**Different sizes and different plies?**<br>
Right. 

My support hose is 30-40 and that is determined by the PCP (primary care doctor)

General:
**How many hours per week would you estimate you spend on prosthetic sock orders?**<br>
Well, very few. Maybe, MAYBE, a couple hours a week. It depends on how many we get in the mail, how many we call, a couple hours. I don’t think it’s every week. It varies from week to week. 

**What portion of that time is spent on processing phone orders?**<br>
I think we get more through the phone than through the mail. Probably half a dozen throughout the week on the phone. 

**What portion of that time is spent on processing mail orders?**<br>
3, maybe 4 in the mail a couple times a week. 
    
**How many hours per week would you estimate you spend on hearing aid resupply orders?**<br>
Mmm, whatever 8 x 5 is. *laughs* It’s the entire day. 40 hours a week. That’s all we do, 8 hours a day. They call in, order their batteries, sometimes batteries + domes+ wax guards. Sometimes just a case. Sometimes they’ll order a repair kit. It’s a box and they send hearing aids back to us to repair them. You probably get half a dozen of those a week. 

**Is there any consideration for how those prosthetic socks orders are routed?**<br>
It’s usually just random. It used to be that Jeff would do them all but now there’s a couple other people that do them. I’m not usually one of them *laughs*. I answer the phone for hearing aid parts. 
 
**What portion of that time is spent on processing phone orders?**<br>
We have people where they rotate every week for emails. One week they’ll have emails and they’ll send out hearing aid supplies through emails cuz it’s their turn that week. I’d say, it just depends on the hour of the day I guess. You get 2, 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch, 97% of the day is doing hearing aid supplies period. Through the phone. 

**What portion of that time is spent on processing mail orders?**<br>
They send them in on a blue card and it gets separated and we all do a portion of them. Mondays and Fridays are our busy day. We get a lot of cards. You grab a couple stacks and get them done in a day or two. I would say… personally I do them in between calls. I’ll take a call, and when I’m waiting for another call to come through I’ll do a card. So, I don’t know. Probably half the time?  

Hearing Aids - General:
**What can be challenging about hearing aid orders?**<br>
Uhm, people getting frustrated cuz they sent their hearing aids in for repair and they don’t know where they’re at because they were told 3 weeks and it’s been over a month or whatever. They get frustrated because they ordered batteries, we sent them out, and 2 weeks later they still don’t have them. You go in the system and the system says they were delivered. And so we have to send them some more. 

**Do you know if these customers are getting communications after placing their order?**<br>
The only communication they get, if we have their email when we send the package out they will automatically receive an email. 

**Does it have tracking?**<br>
Yeah, it has a tracking number attached to it. 

**Do you know how they originally get their emails?**<br>
They give them to us?

**How so?**<br>
On their cards or through their audiologist. I’d say 90% of the time they’ve put it on their card and we put it in the system. 

**Do you have any challenges?**<br>
We have a binder that we go through and it breaks down each hearing aid and what parts it takes. We also have ROES which stands for Remote Order Entry System and the audiology clinic is supposed to put their information in that. If we send the wrong thing that’s because the audiologist put it in the system wrong. Or they’ll say the audiologist put in a 7mm dome but it doesn’t fit, can I go higher? And we say they can go higher but not lower, because if they go lower the dome can go into their ear and they need to go to the emergency room to get it removed. 

**Do you often see Veterans who order hearing aid resupply through multiple channels by choice?**<br>
Most of them call. I probably say 75% of them call and the other 25% send a card in. Some of them may do both, and after a period of time they haven’t gotten their supplies they’ll call and say they sent a card i and ask if their supplies are on the way. You gotta look in the system and tell them it’s on the way, got lost in the mail, we don’t have it, whatever. 

**Do you have anything else to say?**<br>
No, not really. My father-in-law had them and I guess a lot of people cant live without them. 

**Is there any one or a couple changes we could make to improve ordering for hearing aid resupply?**<br>
Well, I think Pat is working on that. He’s sending a different type of card out and now the card shows make, model, battery size, and an area underneath that says accessories and they can write that in there. Pat is sending out a different type of card with battery on the front and on the back you can put down tubes, wax guards, that kinda thing.

Socks - General:
**What are some of the ways you find that sock customers differ from hearing aid customers?**<br>
Mmm, basically just that. They’re ordering socks vs hearing aids. Some of them got both, so. You just gotta go through and order their hearing aid stuff for them and then look at what socks they need. We do not carry compression or diabetic socks. We get a lot of calls about that. They’ll be upset because they thought it said they could order diabetic socks. 

**Do you know where the breakdown is happening?**<br>
I really don’t. It might just be in their mind, you never know. It might be… I’m not gonna say it is the clinic, but it may be it is the clinic who is giving them the number. If they are, why are they telling them that? You can see where that gets frustrating for them. 

**What can be challenging about sock orders?**<br>
I can tell you there have been a couple of times where I have ordered them the wrong thing. I order what they got in the system and they’ll call back 2-3 weeks later that it’s the wrong size. They have to get themselves measured by their primary care doctor. Their doctor will give them their measurements. Or the prosthetic department will measure them and place the order for them. Maybe they’ve lost weight, gained weight, there’s a lot of things that could happen that would change your sock size. 

**They just say give me the last thing and maybe they change size and they don’t realize they’ve changed sizes?**<br>
Right, exactly right. 

**It’s not realizing you’ve gained weight, alright. They’re supposed to go back and get resized? Is it enforced?**<br>
In the prosthetic department at the local hospital, they would do it. I’d have to do it myself. You have to make an appointment with the prosthetic department, and in my case they ordered my stuff for me. I’m sure that’s what they do for a lot of people. This is what you took last time, this is what you need this time. 

**If someone calls in and says they gained weight are you able to accommodate that request?**<br>
Only if they know what size they need. You don’t know, cuz you’re not there putting their sock on. 

**If you think they do need another one, you suggest they get resized?**<br>
I would. 

**What are the most common problems you see Veterans encounter with ordering socks?**<br>
Some of them will have socks underneath their socks so they can pull their socks on easier. They call it the sheath, so they can pull the sock up over if they’re sweaty or whatever so they don’t tear. 

**What is the most common complaints you hear from sock customers?**<br>
Wrong size. They wanted a specific brand. There’s Knit-Rights and a couple other companies. I’m pretty sure we use Knit-Rights now but I’m not sure about other ones. They’re used to that brand and don’t want to switch. 

**Do they ever want to try another brand?**<br>
No. 

**How frequently are Veterans placing their orders for socks?**<br>
Not very. They’re calling a couple times a year. They get a 6 months of socks, batteries, domes. Whatever they need.

Socks - Phone:
**In a given month, can you tell me about the “types” of sock customers you’ll get calls from?**<br>
Hmm, no. A lot of them have an amputation of what they call right leg blow knee, left leg above knee. They’re getting some type of sleeve for not having an arm. 

**So you service more legs than arms?**<br>
Oh, yeah. 
    
**Can you describe the conversations you might have with these customers?**<br>
“Hey this is so and so, my last 4 is this. I need to order socks” You go into their record and see they ordered socks in the past and say, “I show you use this particular sock and this brand and this size. is that what you need” and they say yay or nay. And then you order it from there. 

**Does it vary ever?**<br>
No. 

**What are some of the more uncommon requests?**<br>
I don’t recall any, no. 

**How long does that take?**<br>
Depends on if they’re chatty or not. 

**Do you find people are chatty?**<br>
Sometimes

**What do they talk about?**<br>
Oh, just their life and how things are. How they don’t wanna be going through what they’re going through but they deal with it. How’s the weather or your family. You know, like your next door neighbors. 

**How do you deal with that?**<br>
Nothin’. I’m cordial with them. If they get too chatty I interrupt and say, “Excuse me. I have other people to get to I’m gonna have to let you go” and then I let them go. A long time ago I did customer service for payroll and the gal who was my supervisor said they’ll never hear you say a derogatory word to them or be mean to them because if you are then they’ll be coming into the office and talking. 

**Can you tell me about some times when you struggled to help sock customers who have called in?**<br>
I have to refer to Jeff all the time. When they call in and say, “I need to order this” I’ll say, “Okay I don’t know how to do this” and I’ll go to Jeff cuz he’s always done it. Or we get a card in the mail and let’s say the top of their leg’s 4, middle of leg is 6, and bottom of leg is 3, and I need to order socks for this and you don’t know how to do that. That’s when you go to Jeff and go, “I need you take care of this for me please”. He’s always done it so I think mostly we need to be trained. We never had any formal training as far as ordering socks goes other than doing whatever they ask you to do on the phone. 

**The dimensions are a problem. Any other issues?**<br>
Mostly dimensions. Or they ordered wool before and want wool now but we don’t carry wool. But they’re having heartburn over now getting their wool ones. So you go to Jeff and ask what to order for them and he’ll deal with it. 

**What does referring to Jeff look like?**<br>
We just put them (the veteran) on hold and you go over to talk to Jeff and that you’re transferring someone over there and give them their name and social and transfer them over. 

**It’s happening in the same call? They don’t get called back?**<br>
No.  

**What do you think motivates a customer to call rather than order online or by mail?**<br>
I don’t really know. Maybe they want to specify… maybe they don’t think that writing it out in an email specifies what they’re looking for. I mean, I don’t think I could write out what I need. You’re gonna end up calling the, back anyway and say, “I see you say this, this, this, but in the system we only have this.” You gotta call them back and discuss them with somebody. Or maybe Jeff will call them back. 

**There becomes a point where they ask things that become too much and you gotta refer to somebody?**<br>
Right. 

**If they do want a different size and they gained some weight, do you accommodate?**<br>
Personally, I wouldn’t be able to. I don’t think Jeff would be able to. I’d tell them to go get measured. 

**Have Veterans on the phone ever expressed any thoughts about ordering online?**<br>
No. As far as socks go, no. They’ll go on eBenefits and say, “Oh I see I can order socks. Can I order socks?” Then you look at their file and see they can order hearing aid batteries. So no, we can’t order you socks. 

**Have Veterans on the phone ever expressed any thoughts about ordering by mail?**<br>
No. Not as far as socks go. Some people do order by mail but that’s because they know what they need. 

**What problems do you see commonly occur with phone ordering?**<br>
I don’t do it that much, so I don’t see much of anything.

Socks - Online:
**How often do you see sock orders being placed online?**<br>
Uhm, well, just seeing Jeff do it yeah.  

**What does he do?**<br>
He would go through email or we send them the email and he goes through the email and looks at their record and order what they need. 

**So email, not eBenefits?**<br>
Right

**So those eBenefits orders, do you see anything related to those?**<br>
It’s a background process. I’ve never seen any of them. 

**What do you think motivates a customer to order online rather than by phone or by mail?**<br>
Uh, time. Cuz, say we had a hundred people on the phone. Callbacks and people waiting to touch somebody. They don’t wanna sit on a phone for half an hour, 45 min, but if they do they’ll tell you about it. “Do you know I’ve been on the phone for 45 min waiting to do this that or the other thing” and you’re like “Sorry! Nothing I can do about it” 

**Idk how familiar you are with the tool**<br>
I’ve gone into it a couple times. I’ve shown veterans how to order them online.  That’s about the extent I can do. 

**What are the highest impact changes we could make to online ordering to improve a sock customer’s experience?**<br>
Well, first of al they need to figure out what’s going on with eBenefits. A lot of people say they got their wrong information in there or they put their SSN and they’re not in the system or they got the wrong sock size, hearing aid battery, whatever. Then you just pass that on. Given to the powers at be. 

**When they say it has the wrong sizes in it, do you go in and check and tell them it’s the right size?**<br>
No, I have never done that. If I’m not mistaken, isn’t eBenefits a third party?

**eBenefits is developed by the VA or some government entity. It’s not entirely third party at least. Our goal right now is to put it on VA.gov.**<br>
I know they get frustrated a lot because they’re not able to order their batteries or they’re being told the wrong batteries to order. Maybe the system’s not updated yet. 

Socks - Mail:
**What are the biggest problems you think customers have in ordering their socks via mail?**<br>
Not knowing exactly what their circumferences are. 

**That’s something you’d clear up on the phone, yeah?**<br>
Mmhmm.

**What do you think motivates a customer to order via mail over online or via phone?**<br>
They would rather send email or order online than, as I said before, waiting for long periods of time. 

**What kind of comments do customers put into the ‘Additional Comments’ section on the paper form?**<br>
I’ve not seen any comments, to be honest with ya. 

**What problems do you commonly see occur with mail in orders?**<br>
No (problems). 

**Is there anything else pertinent to us creating an online system?**<br>
Make it as user-friendly as possible. That’s our biggest issue. 

**Have you had complaints about that specifically?**<br>
Yeah, yesterday I had a couple calls about people trying to get into eBenefits for an hour, 45 min. They’ll call after not being able to get in. 

**Is that a common occurrence?**<br>
It’s not super common, but it happens. 

**If you were to estimate over a month, how many times would you hear that?**<br>
Maybe a dozen times or more. Proportionally it’s probably not that much. But for that particular thing that is a lot. 

**Do you have any questions for us?**<br>
Mmm, nope. I don’t!
