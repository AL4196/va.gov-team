# DALC Thumbnail mapping review (Iteration 1)
## Agenda:

#### Attendees: 
Matthew Self, Nick Wygonik, Riley Orr, Rebecca Walsh, Amen Ra, Kevin Q

#### Background:
Our team, Benefits & Memorials 2, is working on modernizing the digital mechanism Veterans use to order medical devices. Practically, this means working with Veterans to design and launch a new ordering mechanism on the VA.gov platform.

#### Purpose:
The team is meeting today to present the first iteration of the thumbnail mapping diagram to Kevin Q. so he can provide feedback on the direction that the team is headed with the design. The focus will be specifically on the "ordering process" portion of the form. 

#### Outcomes:
The design team will have feedback that can be implemented into the second iteration of the flow. 

#### Structure:
- Present the thumbnail mapping diagrams that the design team has been working on, with an emphasis on the “ordering process” portion (5 min)
- Open discussion about specific parts of the diagram (25 min)

## Questions:
- [ ] Would we be able to save in progress?
- [x] Examples of comments Vets leave?
- [x] Why are there so many socks in that sample? ~20/50?
- [ ] Are items able to be related to devices?
- [ ] Do hearing aids have more than one available battery for each model?
   - [ ] Do Veterans need the ability to switch to other batteries compatible with their HA?
   - [ ] Given that accessories aren't related to HA models, how do you envision collecting accessory requests from the Veteran?
- [x] Where does the DLC store addresses? [Eng]
- [ ] A rep mentioned that veterans' records can get out of date, can you explain how that might happen?
- [ ] Users can have multiple hearing aids as part of their file - is it possible that the wrong hearing aid could be decommissioned if they got a new one?
- [ ] Can a user be completely taken out of the DLC system?
- [ ] Do you envision the ideal solution being a single form for all DLC product lines, or separate form flows for product lines? Why?
- [ ] If we’re allowing Veterans to order hearing aid batteries/accessories from the past 2 years, how many different unique items do Veterans typically order within a two year period?

## Notes:

### Riley's Notes

* Veterans may have up to four hearing aids on record 
    * May have primary and backup pairs 
* Hearing aids can be prescribed per ear
    * This information is very important; there should be visual aid that indicates the ear per battery 
* The DLC would like Veterans to be able to order accessories from the past two years 
* Kevin had a suggestion to adjust the flow to accommodate: “We saw you ordered these items perviously. Would you like to add them to your order?” for items ordered in previous orders instead of just the most recent order
* Reasons the Veteran would use the “Additional requests” comment box:
    * If they need a different item not listed 
    * If they need a different size 
* If additional comments are not submitted by the Veteran, the order process would be automatic on the DLC’s end
    * Based on the experience staff has with orders, they would likely be able to complete an order without additional intervention even if additional comments are included 
* “Why are a majority of the example comments about prosthetic socks?”
    * “Possibly the stack of cards that Jeff grabbed had been sorted to grab sock orders. It looks like he just happened to grab a group of cards that were sorted as socks and separated from the stack of order cards.” - Kevin
        * May not be best representation of the comments
    * Cards requesting batteries/accessories you will see comments of the same nature 
        * "Please send this quantity" 
        * "I don't need domes this time"
        
 ## Next Steps
* The design team would like the additional questions to be answered. This could be done via email similarly to the previous set of questions unless the team suggests otherwise
* The design team will process the feedback that Kevin provided and begin working on a second iteration
