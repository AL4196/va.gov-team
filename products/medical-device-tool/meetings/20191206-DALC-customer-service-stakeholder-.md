# DALC Customer Service Stakeholder Interview<br>
## Agenda:<br>
The moderator will guide the stakeholder through a set of questions  

#### Attendees: 
Matthew Self, Nick Wygonik, Riley Orr, Rebecca Walsh, DALC CS Stakeholder

#### Background:
Our team, Benefits & Memorials 2, is working on modernizing the digital mechanism Veterans use to order medical devices. Practically, this means working with Veterans to design and launch a new ordering mechanism on the VA.gov platform.

#### Purpose:
- Gauge the types of Veterans who use each ordering method and why
- Understand the problems that the CS Reps see Veterans encountering with each of the ordering methods
- Understand the problems that the customer service division themselves are having with each ordering method

#### Outcomes:

#### Structure:
- The moderator will guide the stakeholder through a set of questions (55 min)
- The moderator will open up the floor allowing observers to ask questions (5 min)


## Notes:
Note: **Moderator is in bold**

**There’s gonna be some overlap of some things I’m gonna ask you, but we’re going to try to get more granular. It’s a decent-sized list of questions, so sorry about that.**<br>
It’s okay! I wanna help us do the best we can on this thing

**I see Matt has joined us, so we’re good to go. Do you mind if I record?** <br>
Sure! 

**Some of our goals: gauge the type of Veterans and their motivations; paint a picture of the types of customers you see, understand the problems that the reps are seeing veterans encounter with each of the ordering methods, and understanding the problems that the customer service division is having with each other ordering methods. 
I think we can start off by talking about prosthetic socks. When ordering socks, what do you think motivates veterans to order through phone, mail, or ebenefits?**<br>
Well, I think the benefit over the phone is there can be some slight changes since their last order. The thing with socks is, uhm, if they gain or lose weight they’re gonna need a little extra thickness or less thickness to have a proper fit within their prosthesis. If they want to explain that or ask questions they prefer to speak to a live person instead of sending in a card or eBenefits method.

**Do you find that this happens a lot?**<br>
Uhm, I already had a couple today *laughs* that had to explain their situation and we had to work through the process and make some slight adjustments. Uhm, I’m trying to think out of a percentage of the overall number of orders. I’d say it’s probably 50% calls, 50% cards. I don’t know too many that use the eBenefits. One of the issues with eBenefits is if they’ve recently ordered something it won’t let them place an order. If something’s on backorder it won’t let them place an order. With socks there’s so many sizes so most is buy and demand. So, it’s always on backorder. I don’t know, I think the total number who use eBenefits for sock orders has to be pretty low. 

**Guesstimating a 50-50 split between phone and mail. Do you think that there’s anything that motivates Veterans to order through the mail than the phone?** <br>
The ones that know the drill and they get the same sock every time it’s pretty simple. They fill out the card, drop it in the mail, and they forget about it. So, I think for those folks rather than trying to call through and sit on hold to speak with us… a lot of them will even attach a piece of packaging from previous order which helps us further solidify that they’re ordering the same thing as last time. The benefit of mail for the sock is convenience. 

**They’re attaching the skew or something of the products and sending it through the envelope?**<br>
On the package it will have the size up in the corner. A lot just cut that piece off and stable/tape it to the card instead of writing it out on the card. Sometimes they just put it in the envelope. But then, we just glance at that and look at their record to verify it’s the same and then place the order and it’s done. Simple as that. 

**I know you’ve said eBenefits is a negligible amount of people. Do you think there are any motivations for veterans to use the ebenefits method of ordering?**<br>
Oh, sure! I think everyone is tech savvy these days. We’re all ordering online so there are tech savvy amputee veterans out there who if they have a common sock that they do sock they can just go online. Once they get through the log in process, which we’ve discussed in some of the earlier meetings, all you’re doing is checking a box and hitting submit and it’s done. For those folks who are tech savvy and have a common sock they just log in, do that simple process, and they’re done. I think that would be the overall goal for it. For every product, not just socks. 

**And going forward you’ll have to forgive me if there’s some duplicate questions. So when it comes to ordering socks through the phone, can you describe the type of customers the service rep may get calls from?**<br>
Yeah, okay so I got a call from a guy today and he’s a long time customer, I’ve talked to him many times, but he needed a different sock so I brought up his record and looked at what he had. He wanted the same material and same ply, which is the thickness, but the ones we sent him last time were too narrow. We needed something wider. What I mean by that is there’s two measurements. If you picture an amputee with a rounded stump, if you will, at the top we measure across when it’s laid flat. If you measure a couple inches from the botton and measure that then we take that. So sometimes Veterans will say they’re having trouble with their toe. The third measurement is the length of the sock. This Veteran needed it wider and shorter, so I had to go add that particular sock and then place the order. That feeds over to our logistics folks who work with the vendor and they ship it out. I don’t know if that answers your question or not. 

**That’s a great example of someone who is a more complex case! Are there any other unique needs that come through?**<br>
Okay! Another one that came through today. A veteran had historically been using 8-ply wool socks and all of our vendors have discontinued that particular thickness. A lot of companies are getting away from wool and particularly the thicker ones for whatever reason. So, in this case he wanted something we can no longer get. We had to work through a solution in his case. The thickest we can get right now is 6-ply, but the company we use can add extra fleecing, the fluffiness, so if you add that extra fleecing it sort of adds another ply. So 6-ply plus fleecing is like 7-ply. So he’s gonna try it, and he may come back in a couple weeks to try something else. If a simple solution like that doesn’t work then we have to refer them back to their healthcare provider. We’re not technically qualified for that kind of thing. It’s worth a try to see how it goes. 

**As an aside, how are the reps doing or finding alternative products. Is there a single system?**<br>
The Veterans?

**No, the veterans calling this particular issue. How do you solve that problem?**<br>
Well, if it’s a complex one they get referred to me just so the customer service reps due to high volume and workflow we want them to stick to basic routine stuff. They can go into basic research, but stuff like this gets sent to me. I would work with logistics, the place that sends logistics to vendors, or I have all the vendor catalogues and flip through to see if something works. I’ll ask if we can get this sock and this ply, or measurement. Yeah, I guess that’s about this. Hope that answers your question!

**Very thankful for any and all of that information! Going back to what type of sock customers you see, the orders can consist of sending orders they had last, the examples you mention, are there any other types that are outliers?**<br>
Uhm, I’m trying to think. I guess sometimes they’ll have three or four different socks. It might be a combination of a sock and a sheath. Maybe this time they want 5-ply sock and a sheath and next time they want 3-ply sock and sheath, or sock and no sheath. Sometimes they want everything they want last time, sometimes they want one or the other. 

**So this is another tangential question: If they are asking for something different and that’s put into eBenefits, are they able to order all that at once?**<br>
I think it’s got the built in timeframe, same ones as the hearing and batteries. Technically they’re supposed to do an order every 6 months so the system has a 5 month wait built in. If they have two or three sizes on there they can check all three, hit submit, and they can take all three or one or two. 

**So they can do that?**<br>
As far as I know! I haven’t actually looked at that piece.. I don’t know I’ve ever been asked that before. 
I think so few Veterans actually order the socks online. I’m gonna check into that now that you’ve brought it up. I’m curious to know the answer on that one. 

**Are the callers always the Veterans themselves?**<br>
No. Family members, sometimes order. I just recently dealt with a veteran’s wife. She knew exactly what he needed and was talking on his behalf and that’s fine. We’ll get clinics and they’ll ask if they can get a certain sock or certain ply, that kinda stuff. Clinicians, spouses/family members/partners, all that. 

**Do they have to provide information of that person?**<br>
Right, we always verify that. We’ll require them to give the name and the last 4 of the social security number. That person’s been given that information so it’s a legitimate call. 

**Are all agents equipped to handle all types of requests. The more complex ones get handed to you, we can skip that one. Do you think we’d be able to access a handbook or a training guide for the representatives?**<br>
Uhm, I just kinda show them the catalogue and it’s got all the naming conventions and everything in there. The order process for a sock is the same for all the other commodities. We just explain it’s the same guidelines of 6 month supply. I don’t have a particular step-by-step just for socks. It’s the same ordering process for every commodity. 

**Maybe we would be able to find some value in seeing what the general rules of engagement are between the CS reps and the veterans even if it’s not specific to socks. We can circle back to that as well. What are the benefits to ordering the socks over the phone?**<br>
Well, I think it’s the fact that we can tell them if we have it in stock or if it’s on backorder. We can confirm all the measurements. We can confirm the order’s been placed. I guess that’s it. 

**What about negatives or most common complaints about ordering via phone?**<br>
Probably just getting through right now with the call volume the wait times can be long. Mondays are really busy, days after holidays are busy, we just filled some vacancies. The biggest complaints right now is getting through. Once we’re staffed they’ll go through quickly. 

**From the representative’s perspective, what are the benefits of receiving the orders through the phone?**<br>
Well, I can say the biggest problem is we’ll get a card that has all the information you’re requesting but they don’t always fill it out completely. If you have a question you can try to check the record and hope there’s a phone number and reach out but a lot of times the phone number isn’t in there and they don’t have email, so you’re stuck trying to do business via snail mail. 

**The pro would be that the representative can ask followup questions in real time?**<br>
Right, good way to put it. 

**Are there downsides to receiving the orders via phone?**<br>
Uhm, I mean not professionally. The ones that used to get 7 and 8-ply when the vendors cut that off we had to break the bad news with a lot of people and it didn’t go well with a lot of them. They can get verbally abusive but that’s part of the job. Professionally there aren’t any but personally there’s some verbal abuse. 

**Do these customers who order by phone continue to? or mix and match?**<br>
I say mix and match. Once you determine what they need, I can think of a guy I was working with who was doing trial and error, he is strictly by mail. We figured out what worked for him and he’s just been going with that. I haven’t talked to him in a long time but I see his orders come through. 

**What type of customers often send their orders via mail?**<br>
Uhm, I think just the ones where they know what they want and have had the same sock forever. There’s no changes, it’s like clockwork for them. They know the process, a lot of stuff like I said is buy and demand so they know if they need it a month from now then they’ll mail the card in now. They know the drill. When something’s on backorder we’ll send a letter to them saying their particular sock isn’t in sock and on backorder. A lot of guys will write on the card, “don’t need to send letter” cuz they know the drill. It’s the same thing over and over for them. They don’t need us to tell them it’s on backorder. 

**Can you describe the additional comments that veterans leave on the order forms?**<br>
Uhm, I guess sometimes they may come in a little early and to justify that they’ll just write some comment like, “Last socks already worn out” or something like that to let us know why they’re ordering a little sooner. We’re not ever gonna say no, so, we could even put that in our remarks when we place the order in case anyone from upper management asks why we placed the reorder so soon so we have a documentation explaining why we did what we did. Maybe a comment like that, or if the last order was in some way defective we would put a remark on the order why we’re reordering. If a vet says, “Lost weight, need thicker ply this order” or something we can put that on the remarks in the order too. 

**Is that usually enough? How often is it not enough information and you need to reach out?**<br>
Yeah, I mean hopefully they’re specific, like if they want 10 inch this time or something like that. Another thing… so with the sizes there’s standard measurements. A size one has a 7 inch top and a 4 inch toe, so once in a while you’ll get a guy who wants a size 1 with an 8 inch top and a 4 inch toe. For me that’s conflicting information. Do you want an 8 inch top or a size 1? I won’t guess, cuz you may get it wrong. In that case I may reach out and clarify which one they want. An 8 inch top is a size 2.

**How often do you see that happen?**<br>
Not a ton. 1 out of 20. *laughs* 

**What are the benefits of ordering through the mail from the veterans’ perspective?**<br>
The convenience. If, ya know, you don’t have to sit on hold and dial in. You basically just write your stuff on the card, put a stamp on it, mail it, you’re done. For some people that’s simple. For this tech-savvy world I’d rather just log on and do it. It’s pretty minimal time commitment expectation. We try to keep the form as simple as possible. It’s basically name, last 4, address, top toe length, material, and ply. You write it all in and stick it in an envelope and send. Done. 

**Do you know of any common complaints about ordering through the mail?**<br>
Uhm, I guess any time you mail something you don’t know if it got to the destination or how quickly it was handled. Sometimes on our end if we need more information and we can’t… there’s been times it’s very rare but you have to try to reach out to the veteran and you’re basically unable to for some reason. Then he thinks it’s taken care of and we’re unable to reach him and there’s a big time gap so hopefully they reach out. Then we follow up and say we weren’t able to reach you or contact you. They aren’t sure if it got here and was processed. 

**Are there any benefits to receiving the orders through the mail from the DLC’s perspective?**<br>
I don’t mind the mail, like i said as long as it’s filled out completely. If there’s any discrepancy or missing information then it becomes a pain. We’re back to where you hope there’s a phone number or email on their records so you’re able to get in touch with them and clarify anything you need to. 

**Moving into eBenefits, do you see any sort of strategies that they’re using to order throughout the year?**<br> 
I just think it’s such a small number. I mean, even the number of socks overall compared to all the other commodities we do it’s such a small number. The number of that small number doing it through eBenefits is just minimal. I don’t know. 

**Have you received any sort of feedback on the UI itself? What they’re seeing?**<br>
A couple people have tried it and if you can’t place the order it refers you to make a phone call anyway. Some of the feedback anyway is, “If it’s not gonna work why do you have it?”. I think it just has to do with the fact that there’s so many different sizes and variations. We just can’t stock every single sock on the off chance someone’s gonna order it. Those orders are never gonna complete, so pretty much every one of those people that tries to order through eBenefits is gonna be referred to us anyway. After signing up and trying to use it and then having to call us anyway you get a little feedback that way. 

**So if they go on and try to order something they’ve ordered they often get kicked back that you can’t order it online and they have to call?**<br>
Uhm, no I’m thinking of the ones who haven’t ever been successfully order I guess. It’s an item we don’t carry, we don’t stock it, it’s buy and demand. That kind of thing. I don’t think those ones go through and they ask why they wasted their time. 

**In your opinion, what are the highest impact problems we can solve for veterans ordering socks?**<br> 
They get frustrated cuz we don’t keep a lot in sock. It’s just every order is on backorder. That can take 3-4 weeks. So, if someone’s in dire need of some socks and they call us and we place the order and tell them 3-4 weeks then a lot of times they’re not happy, for good reason. They just don’t understand that it’s just not practical to carry every single sock because there’s some that would sit on the shelf forever. 

**I’m gonna switch gears over to hearing aid batteries. There might be a lot of duplication between these, there might not be. I don’t know! When ordering batteries, what motivates veterans ordering through phone?**<br>
It used to be easy to call and order batteries over the phone. For us to place a battery order, I’ve literally placed an order form start to finish in 20 seconds. As fast as he was talking I was putting it in. Done. Now, with our phone volume it’s just, right now someone’s been on hold for 22 minutes. That would be considered an inconvenience I would say. 

**Ebenefits?**<br>
For anybody using eBenefits and in this tech world we live in, why wouldn’t you be able to order online? Just like everything else we order. A lot of people just wanna go on their phone on the website, couple clicks and you’re done. 

**Mail?**<br>
I mean, mail to me, it’s easy. It’s not instantaneous but for some people who plan, they know they got a month supply left and fill out the card, stick it in the mail, couple weeks later batteries show up. It’s simple, but some people don’t want to deal with stamps and that kind of thing. 

We have an automated phone system, and the benefit to that is you can call 24/7. You call in, send in the automatic phone option, enter social security and zip code, and as long as they match the phone will go into your record and go through step by step all the batteries you have available. It’ll start at the most recent aids and say, “If you want to select size 13 battery select 1”. if you select 1.. I can’t remember the exact prompt, you can go to the next one and go to the next one and it will automatically process your order. If it’s been less than 6 months since your last order it will automatically kick you to customer service. If you’ve changed your address it will kick you into customer service. You can call at midnight, you can call on a Saturday. The drawback is that you can’t order accessories. You can order batteries but if you need accessories then you need to contact customers service. 60% of the people have batteries + accessories. That’s one of the drawbacks with eBenefits. The first 10 people log in, order their batteries, and wonder where their accessories are. When they realize they need to call customer service for the accessories it doesn’t make sense why you’d go to two different place when you can call us and order both. eBenefits is under utilized because we don’t have accessories. I think if we put accessories there our call volume would drop 75%. 

**Can you describe the type of battery customers a rep might get?**<br>
Uhm, I mean everyone with hearing aids pretty much needs batteries. There’s newer models that have built in rechargeable batteries so it’s like a cell phone where you can hook it up to a charger. They’re not ordering batteries anymore, but it’s relatively new. I think as technology continues our battery orders will slowly drop off. But that’s gonna take a long time. We also supply batteries for home telehealth. So they may need a double-a battery for a blood pressure machine. If that device is on their record they can also order though us through the different ordering methods. 

**What do the exchanges look like between the rep and different customers they see?**<br>
Batteries, like I said, it’s pretty simple. They call in, you verify you have the correct veteran and verify the address, if theres’s a new address you change it. Then you go to the hearing aid screen and ask them what they want to order. Find out what size they’re requesting, make sure it’s on their authorized list. Then you go ahead and place the order. It’s pretty much a standard quantity. There’s an issue schedule, we call it, where it will say this aid for 6 months needs this many batteries. In most cases you’re just ordering what’s prescribed. You may have a veteran with a special case there they need to wear the hearing aid for 24 hours so you may need to send more and include a remark about that. And that’s pretty much it. Once you hit send, conversation’s over. A basic battery order takes a minute or less without an address change. 

**How many order batteries by themselves?**<br>
40% just batteries, 60% batteries + accessories 

**What kind of accessories are also ordered?**<br>
Right now, the most common are wax filters or wax guards and the other piece is for a hearing aid you wear behind your ear there’s a receiver cord that goes into your ear and is held in place by a dome. Most people order domes and wax guards. 

**What are the benefits of ordering over the phone from the vets perspective? Is there a difference for socks?**<br>
Uhm, ya know I guess just if you had a certain situation that you needed to explain to somebody like you’re coming in sooner because the batteries aren’t lasting as long as they haven’t historically and they wanna run that by somebody. Maybe they wanna get their hearing aids checked out, doing anything different, maybe if they’re streaming 24 hours a day, or streaming devices working with their hearing aids that’ll drain the batteries. Sometimes veterans will just lose their supply and will ask for more. The benefit of ordering by the phone is we can certainly do it for them and make a note on their record. I think that’s about it. 

**Are there any common complaints about ordering batteries besides waiting time?**<br>
Uhm, I don’t think so. I think once they get through everyone here is knowledgeable and professional so I don’t think there’s any problems besides the hold time right now. 

**What types of customers are often sending orders through the mail for batteries?**<br>
I think there’s a good number out there that just can’t hear on the phone so they’ll mail the card. Some have just been doing it that way forever and continue to do it since it works. I think the big thing is the folks that can’t hear on the phone. 

**Can you describe additional comments left on the form?**<br>
I’d say we get a lot of complaints about the battery life that they don’t last as long. Part of that could be a combination of things. With hearing aid technology, like all technology, it’s new stuff and new features coming out constantly. Hearing aids are requiring more power but I don’t think the battery technology has kept up. You get more complaints about how they used to last a week but now it’s 3 days. A while back we switched from [company name] contract, and then we awarded it to a company called Varda. The manufacturing is made in Germany, and for a lot of veterans it’s offensive. So we get complaints about not buying American, or I don’t want those German batteries. Mainly battery life and the fact that they’re not made in the US. Those are probably the biggest complaints we get about the batteries. 

**Do you get special requests in the additional comments field?**<br>
Just maybe to send more, which is fine. We’ll look on their record and if we can tell they’ve got a lot of streaming-type devices then we’ll send more and put a remark in there. 

**Do you think you see a lot more hearing aid users using eBenefits for their batteries as opposed to socks?**<br>
Yeah, definitely. Like I said, if we could get accessories on there about 75% would use it. That might be low. I hear it all day long. I was on phone duty for 3 hours taking calls and I can’t tell you how many times I hear, “I placed my order battery and I couldn’t find where to order wax guard”. 

**Aside from wax guards and the accessories not being included, are there other complaints about online ordering?**<br> 
I just think the.. I haven’t been through the process because I don’t have access to set up an account but I hear just setting up the account and the password expires and trying to create a new password is the biggest complaint. Setting up the account and getting into the actual order form. That’s the biggest complaint we get. Once you get to the form, I mean the order process is so simple. Click a couple of bubbles and hit submit. Click, click, done. It’s just getting to that screen is difficult so that’s the biggest complaint we get. 

**Wrapping up the hearing aid batteries section, in your opinion what are the highest impact problems we can solve?**<br> 
Uhm, the highest impact.. I would say if we could get it on something… Is VA.gov the same as My HealtheVet?

**It’s not the same, they’re separate. But it will be through VA.gov.**<br> 
Okay, the biggest thing is having to go through two different places. They’ll already be on My HealtheVet checking off prescriptions, so they’ll have to go somewhere else to order batteries and socks. If there was a one stop shop to order everything at once I think that would be the biggest benefit for Veterans. 

**What does the ordering process for ordering both?**<br>
Uhm, I mean on the phone just from a convenience standpoint we’ll get some who are in the system for both and we’ll do both at the same time. I guess technically you could do both on eBenefits. I don’t know for sure if anyone’s doing that or not. 

**If they order both the socks and batteries, does the DLC combine them into one shipment?**<br>
No, our warehouses are a little behind the times. Even with hearing aid accessories, if they order batteries and then two accessories that’ll go out in three different packages. If it’s hearing aids and socks then they’ll go into two different packages. They print out two different orders, two different people are packing two different shipments. There’s an initiative to straighten that out too. 

**I wanted to give Matt and Nick a chance to ask questions. I’ve learned a lot! Matt, Nick, do you have anything? 
Nick: I just want to thank you for doing this and spending the time.**<br> 
One thing I didn’t mention: we take orders via email if you want to open that can of worms if you want to learn about that. It’s just time consuming, but we can do that at another time.
