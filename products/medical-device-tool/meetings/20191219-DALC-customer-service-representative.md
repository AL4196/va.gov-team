# DALC Customer Service Representative Interview<br>
## Agenda:<br>
The moderator will guide the customer service representative through a series of questions.   

#### Attendees: 
Riley Orr, Rebecca Walsh, DALC Customer Service Representative

#### Background:
Our team, Benefits & Memorials 2, is working on modernizing the digital mechanism Veterans use to order medical devices. Practically, this means working with Veterans to design and launch a new ordering mechanism on the VA.gov platform.

#### Purpose:
- Learn more about the pain points customer service reps are hearing about from customers
- Become familiar with the pain points for prosthetic socks customers 

#### Key Takeaways (Riley):
- Prosthetic sock orders account for 1-2% of all orders (similar to what the first customer service rep stated)
- Veterans with amputated limbs may be moving away from prosthetic socks due to gel liners 
- Hearing aid customers are frustrated because eBenefits lists that hearing aid accessories can be ordered, but that functionality was removed a while ago 
- Ordering hearing aid accessories was removed from eBenefits due to veterans ordering incorrect accessories because many different brands carry accessories with the same product name 
- One of the greatest challenges is when a veteran’s record is not updated in VISTA/ROES 
- Some veterans are claiming that the batteries they’re using are not lasting as long as they used to. This may be due to technology advancements allowing hearing aids to connect to TVs and cell phones via bluetooth, but not all veterans claiming this use bluetooth technology
- “The population that we serve seem to move quite frequently for whatever reason.” - Receives quite a few calls from veterans claiming they never received their order
- “And so because of the nature of amputations and the shape of the remaining limb, almost every sock is like custom made.” 
- Sometimes veterans are disappointed because they found a sock that they are comfortable using and it’s discontinued when they try to place an order 
- “Some of the veterans don’t even go through us, they just email Jeff directly” 
- The DLC will send out 3, 6, or 12 socks. If a veteran is ordering multiple types of socks, they will still receive 3, 6, or 12 socks for each sock type. 
- “I think we service 3.5 million hearing-impaired veterans.”
- Although not the bulk of their customer-base, the DLC does ship orders internationally 
- Regularly reaches out to Jeff with questions about prosthetic socks orders 
- *Note: Kevin attended our weekly team meeting and confirmed that functionality allowing veterans to order hearing aid accessories was never available online.*

## Notes:
Note: **Moderator is in bold**

**Do you mind if I record this?**<br>
Not at all, please feel free to do so. 

General:<br>
**How many hours per week would you estimate you spend on prosthetic sock orders?**<br>
The prosthetic socks orders are maybe, they definitely have to be less than 5% of all the orders that I do. They may only be 1-2%. We process orders, you probably know all this but I’ll go over it, we process orders over the phones, we process orders by order cards mailed into the DLC, and we process orders over email that come to our email address, and we process them all three ways. They bring in, ya know, mostly on Mondays and sometimes Friday afternoons and throughout the week. Mondays and Fridays big stacks of cards come in from the warehouse. They come in bundles of approximately a hundred. I go through several bundles of a hundred without seeing an order for prosthetic socks. We may be 4-5 prosthetic sock orders and a thousand to two thousand hearing aid orders. There’s 1-2 cards each day throughout the week. Maybe, 30-40 orders a week by cards. The vast majority of my phone calls are hearing aid calls. Maybe once or twice a week I’ll get a prosthetic sock call. Emails, we get several, couple hundred emails a week for whoever is one mail duty. There may be 1-2 prosthetic sock emails if that. So, it seems like the sock orders we have are for the population that has been up to recently. More and more of the artificial limbs are moving to the gel liners. The newer veterans receiving artificial limbs, and even some of the older veterans getting retrofit, are moving away from socks. Our socks is a small percentage of all the orders that we do. Even though I’m a hearing impaired guy, someone who’s an amputee I’m gonna do everything I can and spend as much time as I need to, to make sure they’re taken care of. 

**Are you aware of any online orders coming through?**<br>
I don’t see any of the online orders. For the hearing aid accessories, the accessories are turned off in eBenefits so we get a lot of phone calls about people on the hearing aid saying they’re trying to order accessories and they’ve bene messing around for three hours. You have to say, “Sir or ma’am, it’s not you. Hearing aid accessories are not available” I think it would be awesome if they could get it through My HealtheVet

**Why do you say that?**<br>
When you look at eBenefits, there’s not a lot there. My HealtheVet would consolidate everything. Veterans already go there to fulfill their prescriptions and use the messaging. Another point of frustration I hear every day is, “I gotta go here to do this, I gotta go there to do that, I call this number and it’s not the right number.” The ones who go to My HealtheVet say, “I got all my prescriptions right here. I got my appointments right there. Why can’t I order my hearing aid batteries and prosthetic socks there?”

**How often do you get those complaints?**<br>
Oh, every single day. 

**About specifically wanting it in My HealtheVet?**<br>
Well, about the user friendliness of the eBenefits website or wanting it on My HealtheVet or wanting to get specific items online. 
    
Hearing Aids - General:<br>
**What can be challenging about hearing aid orders?**<br>
So, not so much for me now that I’ve been here for a while, but specifically for the new people working on hearing aid orders. The hearing aid companies are all different names, you got Oticon, Cignia, Phone (something), etc. and those companies have the same items: wax guards, batteries, hearing tubes. Once you learn batteries it’s not a problem. Some of the hearing aids have multiple different types of wax filters, so the veterans themselves frequently don’t know the difference. They don’t even know they need to change them sometimes. When we go into ROES or when we go into VISTA the clinics are supposed to update and put the specific types they need in there, and the vast majority of the time they don’t. I’m not criticizing the clinics, we work for the clinics, it would just be much more easier if we could see it in VISTA so we can tell the veteran, “No worries, we’re gonna go into another record system and look that up for you.” and sometimes in that record in ROES if they switched from ear molds to domes or domes to ear molds, the record hasn’t been updated and doesn’t have the specific time. If it’s an ear mold it’s a larger wax guard, if it’s a dome it’s a smaller wax guard. It can be challenging getting the correct wax guard or dome to the veteran if there’s questions and the records aren’t up to date. 

**Is that a long of back-end work for you?**<br>
It’s mostly back-end work for us. We primarily work in a system called VISTA which is our ordering system. When it doesn’t pop up, it’s not automatically populated in VISTA, then we have to click up another link that opens ROES. And then we have to type int he Veteran’s social, pull up their record, go through everything ordered in ROES, find their hearing aid information, open up their hearing aid information, and then it will tell us if they have ear muffs or domes, what types of wax guards they need. If they need sports locks or retention locks, almost every time we have to go into that additional system and dig in there to see what the receiver size on their hearing aid is so we can order that specific item for them. All that takes additional time when, my leadership supports me but I go over my allotted time to make sure they are serviced well. The flip side is if you spend too much time on every veteran than you have a bunch of them waiting on hold. So, if we could process these a little faster, see into VISTA, we’d be able to. order retention locks much faster. If it was simpler for the clinics to make sure the dome and wax guard size were populated in ROES so we could see it in VISTA then we would hardly have to go into ROES and we could order for the veteran much faster. 

**What are the most common problems you see Veterans encounter with ordering hearing aid resupply?**<br>
The biggest problem that I see is veterans saying the batteries aren’t lasting. Whatever batteries that are on contract right now, the veteran tells us, I don’t know anything about the contract, the veterans are saying the batteries used to last a week and now they last only a couple of days. The first questions we dig into with them are, “Are you waiting long enough once you peal the strips off the batteries” Most don’t realize they’re zinc batteries so they need to have a chemical reaction before you put an electric load on your hearing aids. The new hearing aid technology, veterans are connecting these hearing aids to tv streamers, bluetooth cell phones, streaming music from their computers, and it puts a hurting on the batteries as well. We hear a few complaints from veterans that have been using hearing aids for a long time who don’t want to connect to new technology and the batteries aren’t lasting. 

**How many calls do you get from hearing aid users requesting an update on their order that they haven’t received it?**<br>
Quite a few that they haven’t received their order. When we go into the system, so if they haven’t received an order.. let me back up. As soon as a veteran calls we ask for last name and last 4 social to pull up record. The first thing we do is verify their address. The population that we serve seem to move quite frequently for whatever reason. A lot of retirees that have multiple residences. By verifying that address, “Nope, I moved, I’m at my summer address, the batteries went to the old address” by verifying that right away we can catch a lot of that. The next thing that we’ll do if the address is correct is we’ll go into ROES and check the tracking number. Frequently it says the batteries have been delivered. The veteran says, “Well, I don’t have them”. We immediately reorder and depending upon the situation we send them by united parcel service instead of standard mail. We’ll get those batteries to them right away. The post office will frequently show they’re delivered and the veterans say they weren’t. Whether they’re porch pirated, stolen, we hear packages were ripped open and there’s nothing inside. That’s a lot more rare that not receiving them. In the three years I’ve worked here, I’ve heard it a couple times a month that the package was ripped open and there’s nothing in it. 

Socks - General:<br>
**What are some of the ways you find that sock customers differ from hearing aid customers?**<br>
Well, almost… even though a hearing aid is set up custom by the audiologist for each individual veteran/patient, the type of hearing aid, the battery, the socks are almost all individually custom made. There’s some types of socks that are called sheathes that are some basic individual sizes like small, medium, large. but almost every other sock, the way that you order it, you got the material of the sock, you have the ply or thickness of the sock, you have the size of the sock, and the length of the sock. And so because of the nature of amputations and the shape of the remaining limb, almost every sock is like custom made. So, you’ll have to get that type of material, how thick they want it to be for the amount of cushioning, and the size/length. When we go to order them, the prosthetics doctor has put, of course, just like the hearing aid information, they’ve created a file for them. Authorized it for them, and most of the socks are already in the computer. So, we just verify that that’s what they want, but sometimes a veteran is struggling to figure out the correct sock. It’s just not comfortable for them. So, they’re trying to change dimensions of the sock and that’s when we’re working for them and asking for specific dimensions and figuring out materials, size, ply, length. On the order cards, it asks a lot of different questions. The size number, measurement of width at top, measurement of width at toe, measurement of length, and material/ply. When the card comes in, all that information is on the card. If we’re talking to them on the phone then we ask those questions if they’re trying to order something different than what they had recently. The majority of the times, they’re getting something they’ve had previously.

**You will work with the veterans trying to figure it out. Are there things you cant accommodate?**<br>
The biggest thing is discontinued items. Some times they’re pretty disappointed because they finally got something that works great and been using for a couple years and have to try something else. You can get what you can get. Our logistics section, those guys over there, they just are outstanding working with the vendors and getting what the veteran needs. Once we get the specifics, we work with the guys here at logistics and those guys will go back and forth with the vendor. And the vendors themselves do everything they can to accommodate. It’s just every once in a while that the vendor says they produce so few of them. Then we have to work with the veteran and the logistics to get a suitable replacement. 

**When this happens, how do you know an item. is no longer available?**<br>
The first thing is, I’m in that system called VISTA. I’m trying to order it and it says this item is locked. It means I cant order it on VISTA. What I immediately do is send an email to logistics, logistics will reply that the item is no longer available. Or they contact the manufacturer to see if they can get it made,  or they no longer make it. Logistics knows a lot of this stuff, ask the veteran what they would prefer or start working with. Or, we just cant get anything like that anymore and refer them back to their prosthetics department so the doctor can find them a better fit. 

**Is there anything else that can be challenging?**<br>
The whole ordering process is challenging when you’re a new employee. Everything that goes into it, the measurements, sizes, we have a little cross-reference sheet that teaches us that stuff. Once you process a bunch of orders then it becomes second-nature. 

**What are the most common problems you see Veterans encounter with ordering socks?**<br>
I think that most common problem is discontinued items that they cant get anymore for whatever reason. 

**Are there any other notable ones?**<br>
The process is pretty straightforward. We might use our cross-reference as the main person ordering and Jeff is the prosthetic sock master so some… he’s been doing it for so long that some of the veterans don’t even go through us, they just email Jeff directly. If we have questions, we go talk to Jeff and he kinda lets us know what’s going on. He’ll say this is the best substitution, I haven’t seen that in a long time, etc. 

**Do you have any insight into the frequency with which veterans are placing orders?**<br>
Like I said, they’re a pretty small percentage. Of all the orders the DLC does for socks, it’s probably 1-5%. The vast majority are hearing aids. 

**What about the same veterans over time? Every four months, less often?**<br>
We typically try to send out three, six, or twelve socks. And it depends on the type of sock. The type of sock, typically whether it’s on a leg or arm will need to be washed, laundered, has more friction and wears out. The legs take more abuse than the arms sometimes. We do typically see the same veterans when we pull up their record there’s quite a few orders on there. If we send 6-12, it’s typically plenty for them. Sometimes they will have only received 3 in the past, and the standing policy is 6-12. If they’re like, “I’m not getting enough socks” then we bump them up no problem and they’re real happy when we do that for them

**Are they ordering a variety of socks?**<br>
It depends upon the veteran and the nature of the amputation and artificial limb that they have. Some of them have a sheath and some have a spacer sock, and then some of them have a sock by itself. Some use a combination of sock or something that covers the limb while they’re not wearing the artificial. portion of their limb because they’ll have pain sensations or something like that in their limbs even when their artificial limb isn’t attached if they’re exposed to heat or cold. Theres gel liners, sheathes, all different types of socks, socks that have holes in the bottom because they’ve implanted a pin into the end of their stump so it can engage with the artificial limb better, so there’s a lot of different little individual items in those socks that you need to make sure are correct. 

**Are you ordering multiple sock models in a single call?**<br>
So, sometimes. Again, if a veteran uses a sheath when they’re not wearing their artificial limb and they’re using one type of sock or the ply/width is no longer available so now they’re using a certain type of sock with a spacer sock so their stump isn’t moving around inside their limb then it can get complicated. The majority are only ordering 1-2 type of sock

**If they’re available to receive 6-12, does ordering multiple types reduce the number?**<br>
No, it doesn’t reduce it at all. If they need 4 different types of socks and need 6 of those types, we’re gonna send them to em. If they need 12, they gave their limb for their country. We’re gonna send them to em. 

Socks - Phone:<br>
**In a given month, can you tell me about the “types” of sock customers you’ll get calls from?**<br>
Oh, um, most of them again, most are pretty comfortable. We’ll get a few veterans that have just been recently fitted with an artificial limb and they need help moving through the ordering process. But the vast majority of socks customers have been ordering for a while. We have a few from WW2 and Korea generation, but most of the sock orders I have personally worked with have been from the Vietnam generation and of course the new war on terrorism generation. The older generations have been ordering for a long time and it goes pretty quick. The newer ones we have to work with a little more. If we get a new limb then we need to work with them in order to get them taken care of.
  
**Can you describe the conversations you might have with these customers?**<br>
The vast majority of veterans that I serve very day, and I love my job because I’m a veteran myself and I’m giving back to my own community. The vast majority are thankful for what we do for them. We get a few that are very upset, and we help them navigate the process. We make them a happy camper when they’re done. We get a small percentage that are unhappy no matter what we say or do for them. I’m sure they have a reason for being unhappy, but most of the calls go really really well. 

**Do you just ask them for the different sizes or confirm?**<br>
In any order, any decent customer service rep needs to use active listening. You’re trying to help them with what they want. We go into VISTA, we go into a different section than the hearing aids to pull up prosthetic socks. Sometimes they don’t have a record so we need to refer them back to the prosthetics department and have them inform their doctor. The easiest thing to tell them is, “Denver cant pull up your record” so the doctor needs to go into ROES to see if the disability is listed. We go into that specific section and then the easiest thing to do is hit “order history” then it will pull up every single thing that we’ve ordered and sent out. Confirm their order history, confirm what they’re authorized. If they’re requesting something different or we cant provide it for them for whatever reason, then we start digging into the shapes, sizes, alternatives, and that’s typically… once it starts to get complicated then that’s when the customer service rep will go to Jeff and the two of us will sit down to work it out and call the veteran back. Amputees get special service from us, so we’re not worried about getting back on the phone with everyone else. We’ll immediately call them right back. 

**Can you tell me about some times when you struggled to help sock customers who have called in?**<br>
Again, typically it’s when they’ve got a new limb and they’re trying to figure out the best combination of a sock, spacer, or configuration is. Jeff has worked with so many of these veterans that he is able to just roll this stuff off. He’ll say, “tell them to try this and that together” and if necessary we’ll send them out a couple different combinations of stuff. If it gets too complex though, and there’s been times when, “Jeff, the veteran is asking for this and this is what they have on their record and it doesn’t work right” then Jeff will say we need to refer them back to their prosthetics doctor. 
    
**What do you think motivates a customer to call rather than order online or by mail?**<br>
I think it’s kind of the same thing that… in the majority of cases it’s the same thing that motivates a hearing aid customer or any other customer to speak with a customer service representative. They may have a specific question about a change, or feel more comfortable speaking with a person than dropping a card in the mail. It’s a generational thing as well. Some of the older generations feel more comfortable calling and speaking, some of the newer generations would rather order it over the internet. They’re comfortable with that level of technology. I have 80-90 year old veterans who love technology but a vast majority are comfortable with a card. 

**Have Veterans on the phone ever expressed any thoughts about ordering online?**<br>
I don’t hear a lot of sock orderers that want to order online. I constantly hear that hearing aid people want to order online. That this process is frustrating.. I think we service 3.5 million hearing-impaired veterans. Mondays and Fridays are extremely high volume times. For whatever reason that’s most convenient time to get in touch with us. Some wonder why they cant get the items over the internet. 

**Have Veterans on the phone ever expressed any thoughts about ordering by mail?**<br>
The only thoughts about ordering through mail is the length of time it takes. It’s a legacy system almost. In this age of Amazon, where even if they call Amazon’s representative they get the box in two days. What I explain to them is, “Sir, they go out in the US postal service mail”. Amazon, you pay for that service. We’re trying to get it as quick as we can while still providing value to you and the tax payers. A lot of veterans, they’ve gotten used to super quick deliveries when they buy things and wonder why when they mail in a card it takes a week or two to get to us, 1-2 days to process, it’s mostly the postal service. 

Socks - Online:<br>
**Are you familiar with the UI?**<br>
I am not. Jeff may very well be. As a customer service representative, I only hear about online orders when they don’t work. “I try to place this order online, I thought it went through, it’s been 3 weeks and I haven’t seen anything” and I can’t tell anything about the online system. All I can see is when the last order as placed, ooo an order as placed, it did go through, and forever reason it didn’t get to them. Then I am immediately reordering. 

**Do you have any hearing complaints from customers aside from, “Oh, I haven’t received it” about ordering online?**<br>
No, most of the online orders… I get people asking for the ability to do that. “Why can’t i order hearing aid accessories” I’m a smaller cog in the wheel, so I’m just telling you what I hear. I don’t know why the policy is the way it is, but what was explained to me. You got Cignia, Oticon, like you have Ford, Chevy, well they all use wax guards. And some of the wax guards have the exact same name. So many incorrect items were getting ordered that they pulled it off the online system. There would probably need to be a lot more coding or however those items are listen on the online ordering system. Would have to be by specific part numbers, or I don’t know. For Phone Ac and Rezound both use a wax guard with the same name so it’s easy to get them mixed up. A cost has been incurred, and now the veteran has the wrong item, and those need to be returned, and another shipment needs to go out. At the time, a decision was made at a higher level for these times of items needing a veteran to talk to a customer service representative so the correct shipment goes out. What I hear from the veterans, and even though I am hearing-impaired, I have not tried to order them online. I got all my supplies from Ft Bevoir when I was still in the army and was in that transition period where I could swing by the clinic and get supplies. Now they keep a minimum amount of supplies at the clinic for emergencies, but we ship everything, and it makes sense to send everything out from one warehouse. Why keep a bunch of inventory at clinics? What I hear from the veterans is it says “Hearing aid batteries and accessories” online, but they try to order them and can’t get them. 

Socks - Mail:<br>
**What are the biggest problems you think customers have in ordering their socks via mail?**<br>
We work in customer service so we hear the complaints and the problems. It seems like when we literally ship millions of items out of the warehouse, it’s a good process working well. They come out of our warehouse, from what they’ve explained to me, they go into a tractor trailer, and then they go to the sorting facility (unless they’re local), all the way in the next state, and then they go from that Kansas hub to literally all over the world. Majority are throughout the united states, but we send to overseas veterans in Guam, Australia, Europe, Israel, the Middle East, we process a few hearing aid orders every week that go to veterans working overseas or retired overseas for whatever reason. It’s a very small percentage, almost like the socks overseas orders. The length of time that it takes to get delivered. Maybe if the contract went from regular US Postal mail to USPS 2day. From my POV, I would think that would be extremely expensive. 

**What kind of comments do customers put into the ‘Additional Comments’ section on the paper form?**<br>
Well, I’m looking at one right now that says, “Merry Christmas!”. I actually, to prepare for the call, I ordered several cards that have been processed already. It has the standard socks he’s always ordered and int he comments “Requesting prosthetic liners, drying stand by Autoboc”

**Is that enough information?**<br>
The prosthetic liner, I would be able to figure out. The drying stand, I’ve never heard of, so I’d go speak to Jeff. If Jeff knew what it was then we would get that ordered and that would save time/effort calling the veteran and everything else. If Jeff doesn’t know what that is, then I would ask the veteran specifically and look it up and sometimes call prosthetics. 

Jeff explained this is important for process improvement. I am actually not clear what the group is that I’m speaking with. 
**We are a group of contractors working for the DSVA. (explaining project)**
