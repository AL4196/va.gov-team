# VSP design intent check-in

#### Attendees: 
Rebecca Walsh, Riley Orr, Shawna Hein, Mikki Northuis, Crystabel Reiter, Kevin Hoffman, Emily Waggoner

#### Background:
Our team, Benefits & Memorials 2, is working on modernizing the digital mechanism Veterans use to order medical devices. Practically, this means working with Veterans to design and launch a new ordering mechanism on the VA.gov platform.

#### Purpose:
The design team working on the MDT is syncing with the VSP design team to go over the problem space, the work that we have completed thus far, and the team's next steps. The VSP design team will provide feedback about our current work and guidance on components from the design system to implement, other work that could impact ours, other teams to followup with, etc. 

#### Outcomes:
The design team will take action on any feedback or suggestions. 

#### Structure:
- The design team will provide an overview of the project and problem space and present the current work completed (15 min)
- Open discussion with questions, feedback, next steps, etc (15 min)

#### Notes
**Note:** This document will be updated with additional feedback from the [associated ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/4963) when applicable.

- Kevin Hoffman: Mentions to check out Ryan’s sketch file with interactive cards (Crystabel has sent us the updated Sketch file)
- Shawna: Should schedule a sync about checkout experience with Samara's and Jim's teams (Authenticated experience & e-benefits) 
- Emily: What communications do they receive with this? Do they get communications from eBen? Are we able to contribute to how that communication is written? 
- Hoffman: Confirm the email address that you want it sent to on the confirmation page. In the larger scale, accurate emails is a big concern so we may want to create a pattern around this issue.
- Emily: Samara’s team has worked on address management, connect with them on that portion of our flow. Flag that with the development team on whether or not that will be possible.
- Shawna: DLC is syncing with Vets360, according to the slack threads she read (She has tagged us in this thread!)

#### Next steps 
- Reach out to both Samara and Jim
- Review feedback from VSP team and incorporate into our mockups
