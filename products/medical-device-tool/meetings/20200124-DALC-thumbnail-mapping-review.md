# DALC Thumbnail mapping review (Iteration 2)
The thumbnail mapping flows can be viewed [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/medical-device-tool/design/thumbnail-mapping/README.md).
## Agenda:

#### Attendees: 
Matthew Self, Nick Wygonik, Riley Orr, Rebecca Walsh, Amen Ra, multiple DLC stakeholders including Kevin Q and Jeff 

#### Background:
Our team, Benefits & Memorials 2, is working on modernizing the digital mechanism Veterans use to order medical devices. Practically, this means working with Veterans to design and launch a new ordering mechanism on the VA.gov platform.

#### Purpose:
The team is meeting today to present the second iteration of the thumbnail mapping diagram to Kevin Q. so he can provide feedback on the direction that the team is headed with the design. The focus will be specifically on the "ordering process" portion of the form. 

#### Outcomes:
The thumbnail mapping flow will either be finalized and ready for mockups or additional changes will be implemented based on feedback. 

#### Structure:
- Present the thumbnail mapping diagrams that the design team has been working on, with an emphasis on the “ordering process” portion (10 min)
- Open discussion about specific parts of the diagram (20 min)

## Notes:

* Kevin notes that they prefer to be economical in the number of clicks a Vet has to do (no discourse was had on this subject)
   * It was suggested that confirmation of shipping address and email/contact information be combined to save clicks.
* Jim had some concerns about the 'Additional Supplies' checkbox, saying that the scoping may be too broad. We discussed its similarities with the 'Additional Comments' on the paper version of the form and how we plan to reduce its use with the 'Additional Supplies' checkboxes.
* We requested a list of applicable supplies to be included in the order section.
* Jim had concerns about our ability to tie accessories of any kind (including domes and wax guards) to a specific device. Feels this is not an achievable state.
* Tracking numbers will be available to us, but only after a certain amount of time (1-2 days)
        
 ## Next Steps
* The design team will incorporate the DLC's feedback into the thumbnail mapping flow 
* The team needs to reach out to the DLC to request a list of 'Additional Supplies' items
