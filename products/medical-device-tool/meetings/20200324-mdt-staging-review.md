# MDT Staging Review Meeting

#### Attendees: 
Riley Orr, Becca Walsh, Amen Ra, Mahariel Rosario  

#### Background:
Our team, Benefits & Memorials 2, is working on modernizing the digital mechanism Veterans use to order medical devices. Practically, this means working with Veterans to design and launch a new ordering mechanism on the VA.gov platform.

#### Purpose:
This meeting's purpose was to review the current design in the VA.gov staging environment and discuss updates to align staging and the [Invision prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/6MVTG94WNH5). 

#### Outcomes:
The existing pages on staging were reviewed and updates were discussed and documented. Tickets for all updates have been created in Zenhub.
