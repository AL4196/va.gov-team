# DALC Thumbnail mapping review (Iteration 3)
The thumbnail mapping flows can be viewed [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/medical-device-tool/design/thumbnail-mapping/README.md).
## Agenda:

#### Attendees: 
Matthew Self, Nick Wygonik, Riley Orr, Cameron Testerman, multiple DLC stakeholders including Kevin Q and Jeff 

#### Background:
Our team, Benefits & Memorials 2, is working on modernizing the digital mechanism Veterans use to order medical devices. Practically, this means working with Veterans to design and launch a new ordering mechanism on the VA.gov platform.

#### Purpose:
The team is meeting today to present the third iteration of the thumbnail mapping diagram to Kevin Q. so he can provide feedback on the direction that the team is headed with the design. The focus will be specifically on the "ordering process" portion of the form. 

#### Outcomes:
The thumbnail mapping flow will either be finalized and ready for mockups or additional changes will be implemented based on feedback. The additional changes will likely be done in the prototyping phase.

#### Structure:
- Matt introduces Cam (2 min)
- Present the thumbnail mapping diagrams that the design team has been working on, with an emphasis on the “ordering process” portion (8 min)
- Open discussion about specific parts of the diagram (20 min)

## Notes:

* Riley asked if there was ever a need for the DLC to reach out to Veterans about their orders
   * DLC responded that they shouldn't need to due to the new design
* The DLC would rather remove the *Additional comments* box from the flow 
   * Stated that a lot of comments are things like, "Thanks" 
   * Removing this feature would allow orders to be processed without needing a DLC representative to intervene
* Discussed the *Additional items* portion of the flow (generic item checkboxes):
   * There's really no item that could be listed as generic because there may be multiple items of that nature that are associated with the manufacturer or specific model
   * List out the previously ordered additional items, by specific name, as the domes and wax guards are shown 
        
 ## Next Steps
* The design team needs a list of all the *Additional items* that need to be displayed in addition to wax guards & domes so design considerations can be made to the flow 
   * The design alterations will likely be made during the prototyping phase
