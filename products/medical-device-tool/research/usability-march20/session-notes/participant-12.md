Participant 12
==============

Warm up Questions:
------------------

> Before we jump into the session, can you tell me a little about yourself? (If stuck, ask about service, location, occupation, etc.)

I am 72 years old. I'm a Veteran - I served 28 years in the Marine Corps. I served in Vietnam. I've been now working for the Marine Corps for another 23 years - I work at Camp Pendleton working with new technologies and capabilities for them.

> Can you tell me about your hearing aids?

I have the Phonak over the ear hearing aids. I had gone through the previous ones that were inserted in the ear, but because I sit in meetings... I told the audiologist that I have trouble hearing in meetings - which I guess I always will. When I was sitting away from the conference table, I was missing a lot. I had to cup my hand behind my ear, so my audiologist recommended the over the ear to mimic that. It was 4 or 5 years ago that they gave me over the ears. They're terrific - one of the quality of life improvements is that they bluetooth to the television. My roommate used to complain, so now I can hear when it's muted. The VA turned the tables in the household and improved my quality of life. I don't miss important information at work and it's also a great improvement at home. I wake up and put in my hearing aids. Except for sleeping, showing, or working out, I wouldn't go anywhere without them.

> Have you ever ordered hearing aid batteries through the VA?

I ordered my batteries and the little accessories from the VA. I send the mail in form to request them. They send several months worth of batteries and accessories.

> How has that experience been for you so far?

It's actually been pretty painless because I have become so reliant on them that I kind of stay up on... I carry extra batteries on me because it's embarrassing if they die and I lose the ability to participate. The VA here in Oceanside where I get my aids repaired... they've always been really good. I have my old backup hearing aids, they don't work as good as they used to.

> What would make that experience better for you?

Probably being able to go online rather than having to mail off the order form. I really feel for the postal carriers because they've done such a great job. I think being able to order online - I'm not sure if I can, I've never tried to do that.

> If you were to try, what would you look for?

I'd like to be able to access my own VA account then maybe click on something that shows... go into one VA website and then be able to click on a button that says 'order accessories' would probably be the simplest.

> What is your standard VA website?

Just VA.gov.

> What does a typical order look like for you?

Batteries and then I haven't had to order any of the other cleaning parts but there's also... I think they call them wax guards? Are the only other accessories that come with the batteries. And I order those... I order them as a group.

> Where would you expect to go online

> How often do you order?

2-3 times a year?

> Have you participated in usability testing before?

I have done a test with your company before.

TASK 1: 
--------

> Show me how you'd go about placing an order from VA.gov.

-   Goes to VA Benefits and Health Care

-   Clicks on 'Service Member Benefits'

If there was someplace there to... I don't see anything off the top of my head - show me how to make that work to order...

I would look at that point for something that says ... something that would ask me to order parts. I don't know how people with any other medical issues would order...

I would look for VA benefits and healthcare

Oh! It says Manage your health... 

-   Reads list

-   Finds Order hearing aid batteries and prosthetic socks

> What was your reasoning behind going to the Service Member Benefits

It seemed the most likely to me ... as one of the disabilities that I've been authorized through the VA... with those kind of service member benefits. That would be the first place I'd go. It just seemed the most likely to me to go to as a service member as one of the benefits that I'm already privileged to have.

> How clear was the path to get here from the homepage?

Relatively easy. There's a ... I just needed to look around. Took me a few seconds but not an inordinate amount of time. I thought it was relatively simple, not ever having gone there before.

--- Link ---

TASK 2:
-------

> Take a look and let me know if any information jumps out at you

Scrolls through...

Oh! Right there 'Order Hearing Aid Supplies'. Also says phone and I didn't know about that but I would just use the online version...

Looks like it has everything.

For hearing aid repair, I'd just go to the clinic... but it looks similar to the screen we were on before. Seems self-explanatory.

I haven't clicked on this to see what the form is... I guess I'd have to sign into my account.

> Before you click on the link, why do you prefer online to phone ordering?

Well... because of my hearing - I don't use the phone a lot because I normally have to take out my hearing aids to use the plugin device on my phone. So I often have trouble hearing people if they have accents. I find it easier to read rather than use the phone because I don't like asking 'what did you just say?'

> Show me what you would do next if you were going to place an order.

-   Clicks on green button.

TASK 3
------

Sign in or create an account so I would sign in...

Shipping address, email address, hearing aid info... all of that would be at home.

-   Clicks on sign in

> What are your thoughts on having to sign in to place an order?

I think that's appropriate so that everyone would know that it's me. I think that's fine - I don't see a problem with that. It's just one more password and account to add to the list.

-   Clicks sign in

TASK 4:
-------

> Go through the rest of the form and talk me through it

-   Clicks on 'Order hearing aid batteries...' button

Verifying my last 4... dob... gender. If I used this site before, I probably wouldn't even review.

-   Next

-   Selects an address without issue

-   Would re-enter email address

-   Continue

### Add batteries

-   Selects yes

-   Selects a device without issue

-   Notices 'What if I don't see my hearing aid?' --- I'd click on that...

-   Hit's continue

-   Selects yes, accessories

-   Selects item

### Review Screen

-   Looks over to make sure it's all correct

-   Pauses at "Add batteries to your order..." 

Perfect! Seemed pretty straightforward. Very amazon-like. Pretty simple.

### Confirmation Screen

> What would you do now that you've placed the order?

I think I would look for a confirmation email... yep! So I would go to aol and make sure the order had been submitted and that I have a confirmation email.

> Is anything missing from this page?

No, seems pretty straightforward to me.

> What are your thoughts about the overall process?

I liked it. I thought it was very simple. I didn't have any issues with it and normally on this computer - it saves all of my passwords anyhow, so I'd use my fingerprint to get into my VA account anyhow. I think this is pretty simple. I liked it!

Is this a function that is on the VA.gov site already? 

Additional Tasks:
-----------------

### Shipping address

> Imagine there was a typo, what would you do?

Oh that's a good question...

-   Clicks on Edit Permanent Address

I would edit whatever needs editing and once I've done that, hit "Save permanent address"

### Order batteries

> Let's say you want to order batteries, but you don't see the one you want to order batteries for, what would you do?

-   Clicks on additional info

It says call your audiologist to update... it says you can find contact information which I already have. I would call them and they might tell me I might just have to make an appointment.

I'd call them and then hit finish this order later.

> What do you think about having to call your audiologist if you don't see your hearing aid?

Good question... I don't know. If I thought I had enough information... like if you know the battery. So I'd not have any difficulty calling my audiologist but if there were a way to just order the batteries. If I were in a crisis I could just go buy some batteries at the commissary. So I wouldn't have any issues contacting my audiologist.

> What kind of information are you looking at to confirm that it's your hearing device?

The top part that says "Phonak..." and then the battery type. I normally have the case with the information about the hearing aid inside of it. I'd double check the hearing aid information with the information I have at home.

### Order accessories

> Let's say that you want to order accessories, but you don't see the accessories that you want. What would you do?

I'd click on 'What if I don't see the accessories I need?'

Call the DLC customer service section... so I guess I'd have to call them.

> What do you think about that?

I don't know what that is... I know that's where my batteries and stuff come from, but I've never interacted with them. So I'd probably go with email first instead of calling them. And if it wasn't the form I was filling out on the email, I'd have trouble telling what information they really needed. Rather than just ... it might be easier for me if there was just a form I could submit.

> What does that look like?

It would have my name, my contact information, my brand, and contact information... rather than an email.

### Review screen

> Imagine you needed to add another accessory

I'd go down to where it says add accessories and hit the edit button

Hearing aid accessories... it says yes.

And then I'd look to see whatever accessory is listed.

Would hit continue (misses update page)

Follow up questions:
--------------------

> So what kind of technology do you use regularly?

An iPhone, an iPad, and my new Apple MacBook Air

> Do you use any assistive technology? 

No

> Do you enlarge the font on your phone or tablet?

I do sometimes.

> Do you have any challenges using devices?

Well I do sometimes get intimidated by new websites... or if I haven't used it before. Going into a new website for the first time can be intimidating for me. Like if it has a brand new look...

> Can you tell me about an example?

Well now because of quarantine, I do some volunteer work. We normally hold a monthly meeting at a local restaurant. So tomorrow we're going to try to do a meeting tomorrow using Zoom. I'm a little intimidating doing a virtual meeting. It's a new use of a website I've used a couple of times... we'll see how it goes tomorrow.

> Now that you've gone through this ordering method, would you use it?

I would. Absolutely.

> What device would you use to do it on?

I'd use my MacBook Pro because it's so easy to log in on websites with my fingerprint.
