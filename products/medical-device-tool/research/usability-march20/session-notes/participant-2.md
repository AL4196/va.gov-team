Warm up Questions:
------------------

> Before we jump into the session, can you tell me a little about yourself? (If stuck, ask about service, location, occupation, etc.)

I was a Navy corpsman, my final rank was [enlisted] - I served in many areas of the US - a NAVY base, hospitals during training for lab tech, and also served with the CBs in Vietnam. The Construction Battalion (CBs) carries machine guns and hammers. Navy's construction crew, about 1000 men in Vietnam. We had detachments in various locations of Vietnam. I was the Battalion laboratory guy.  They shipped us back to Rhode Island (base) and then shipped to Puerto Rico, where we established the Atlantic Pacific Alert Base. The only time we got an alert, we sat on a plane for a day, but we never left. I was shipped to Florida to work in the new naval hospital, but when I got there, they expected 800 recruits so they discharged him instead. I went back home to Albuquerque, NM, and over the years I became the lab director throughout the US. I retired in Omaha, where I worked in the Methodist medical center.

> Can you tell me about your hearing aids?

I was diagnosed with hearing loss -  which I couldn't tell you the severity of it, maybe mild to moderate - about 8 years ago when I got the first hearing aids from the VA. About 4 or 5 years ago, I got another set, which just replaced a month or two ago. I got new rechargeables that are cool since they don't need batteries. But I do need other things like domes and ear wax catchers. The first set of hearing aids, I didn't get any info from the audiology department about ordering batteries or parts, I had to kind of investigate the DLC. Found their catalog, and I went through that and guesstimated my domes. Ordered them anyway until I found the right pair. Which was unfortunate because I was wasting their resources doing that. With the second set, I was able to order batteries without problems, but not the accessories. I eventually figured out the right ones and ordered those. For these, I have to order domes and ear wax things, which they gave me up front. They didn't tell you that you have to provide the serial number of your hearing aids. I order by email, so I put my serial number. My last order went smooth as silk.

> Do you still order by email?

Yes, I still order through email. This time around, they acknowledged the order and I got it within 3 days.

> Have you ever ordered hearing aid batteries through the VA?

--

> What method do you use to order them?

--

> How has that experience been for you so far?

--

> What would make that experience better for you?

Not now, back then it would have. I got all my info upfront, they fulfilled what I requested. It will probably last me for a long, long time.

> How long?

Well they gave me 2 packs of the domes and I've had the hearing aids for over a month, and there's no reason for me to change them out right now. I lost a dome when changing the ear wax thing. I won't need to refill for a long time unless I keep losing them.

> What does a typical order look like for you?

[Used to order batteries and accessories, now he just orders domes and guards for his rechargeables.]

> Do you usually add accessories to your order?

[All he orders are accessories now]

> How often do you place these orders? 

The old ones, I'd order batteries and they'd ship batteries. About 6 to 8 batteries in each sleeve, and each box had 8-10 sleeves. So you'd get 60-80 batteries. And then one set of batteries would last me about 7 days. So it would be every 4-6 months when ordering batteries. Now that I have rechargeables, I don't anticipate doing any ordering for domes or wax things for at least a year, based upon what I've seen so far with them.

> If you were to do so right now, where would you go to order hearing aid supplies from the VA online?

I don't order them online. If I was to look online, I have no idea where I'd look.

> What would be your first inclination?

I would log in. Well I know where to do it --- it's not VA online, it's a veteran's login place but it's not VA, it's DoD... I rarely log into that one. [I think he was talking about eBenefits]

> Are there any sites that you would assume you could order from?

I'd look at the VA first.

> What site would you look on? Are you talking about[  VA.gov](http://va.gov)?

Yeah, I would look there first, but I don't remember seeing anything on my login there that would let me order supplies like that. It may be there, but I don't remember it. I can actually go there now.

> Lastly, have you participated in usability testing before? 

--

>> How'd it go?

-- 

TASK 1: 
--------

> Imagine that you want to find out more about ordering batteries through the VA online, how would you do that from this page?

-   First instinct was to log in once arriving on[  VA.gov](http://va.gov).

-   He was not familiar with the new[  VA.gov](http://va.gov) homepage.

-   He noticed 'Refill and Track Prescriptions', which he didn't feel was right, but nothing else seemed better, so he clicked on it.

-   Noticed the 'Order batteries and prosthetic socks' link the left hand navigation and clicked on it.

-   Once he clicked on it, he noticed he needed to sign in.

> How clear is the path to get to this page?

Not as clear as I'd like if I was looking for hearing aid batteries. 'Prescriptions' is not a connection for me for supplies.

> What made you click on prescriptions?

It was the only option that had any chance of finding supplies.

> What would you expect to see instead?

Another option on the homepage that says 'Order Supplies' but it could be more specific. Wouldn't have to guess that's where it is. And I do order prosthetic socks through this or the other site I had, I connect directly through my physician at the VA, then it's shipped to me.

TASK 2: 
--------

### Introduction page (Unauthenticated)

-   Noticed blue box first about qualification

-   Noticed telephone and mail options and more information only

 I don't see an email option... so personally, I wouldn't want to spend my time calling the DLC, and I certainly wouldn't want to mail it, it takes forever. I'd like to see an email option on this page. I also don't see where it says whether or not you'll need to enter the serial number of the hearing aids you need batteries for.

> What are you looking for? 

In this call section, it doesn't mention the serial number... which is one of the requirements I ran into. If it's not required anymore, that's great.

> That was a requirement when you called them?

I've never called them, I emailed them. I do know at some point in time, I was told I'd have to provide a serial number, so I just do it automatically now. It may not have ever been required and I was given the wrong information.

> Is there anything surprising or confusing?

Lack of email option.

-   Noticed that the time for shipping is 7-10 days and notes his order arrived faster.

> If you were going to place an order for your accessories online, what would you do next?

I would select the green button.

-   Continued to look over the intro page

-   Noticed that he'd need 'hearing aid information'

They're not specific, what do they mean by that?

-   "That's kind of nice... track your order."

-   So if I was going to order something, I'd click the sign in button.

> What would you expect to see under the "hearing aid information"? 

Model, color, serial number... what? It's too vague. Before I want to proceed, I'd want to have all of my ducks in a row so I could have all my information in hand.

TASK 3:
-------

> What do you think about being prompted to sign in to place an order?

I don't have a problem with that, I have an existing account. I have a DS login and MyhealtheVet account.

TASK 4:
-------

### Introduction page (Authenticated)

-   Read through the info in the grey box - noted that it would prefill.

-   Said he would hit the green button.

### Personal Info page

-   Would validate the info and hit continue.

-   Moved through the section quickly.

### Contact page

-   "I would validate where I live..."

-   Noticed temporary address section

-   Didn't initially select an address -- "Oh wait a minute, I have to pick one of those. I wouldn't normally have a temporary address."

-   Clicked on card button to selec

-   Would fill in the email address input

### Batteries page

-   Noticed the first entry and understands that they're not rechargeable

-   The rest - "I assume these are previous hearing aids that I've owned" 

-   Read last order date of old devices and says he'd definitely need more batteries based on that

### Accessories page

-   Noticed alert saying he can't reorder accessories until [date].

"Oh that's confusing. I think I understand what they're doing.

>What's confusing?

"It says that I can't reorder but they're talking about [ accessory items ] but it doesn't say anything about the batteries which is the only thing that I ordered. It sounds like I can't reorder anything, batteries included. I just ordered batteries and then it pops up saying I can't reorder accessories. Some people will be confused by that, I'd think. Assuming they're not talking about the batteries. We can't order anything else, so we click continue.

### Review page

-   Understood the purpose of the page immediately

"So now it's summarizing ..."

"Now it says "Add batteries to your order... I thought I just ordered them. I realize this is a test system, but I think it's confusing. I think it should confirm first that you did order batteries,.. (?) 12:15.

> Can you tell me a little bit more about that?

It doesn't confirm batteries, it immediately asks if I want to order batteries. I already ordered the batteries, they should just confirm that. THEN it should ask if I want to order batteries for the ones I didn't order. It does the same thing with the accessories, so now it's asking if I want to add accessories to this order.

> On this screen, what would you expect it to say?

I was expecting it to ask to confirm that I've ordered the batteries. Ask if you want to modify the order, then below that say 'you have 2 other hearing aids, do you want to order batteries for those?' What I would do, since I get my hearing aids from the va and I've got 3 sets, I would expect that when one set replaces the last set, you wouldn't offer the opportunity to add batteries for the old hearing aids, because you should be using your new ones. I'm not an audiologist, but it may happen that you lose or damage a hearing aid and you need to use the old ones... who knows? I don't know. You got the idea. You can't throw a lot of questions to someone who's as old as I am without confusing the poor old guy.

> What would you do from this screen? How would you proceed?

Would hit continue.

It gave me a confirmation screen and they say it will give a confirmation in 1-2 days and the...

If you have problems, you call or FINALLY you get an email. It's nice to see the email address, but it should have been back then. I'd exit the screen and do whatever I'd do for the rest of the day.

> Anything missing?

Nope, standard review page.

Follow up tasks:
----------------

### Shipping address

-   Understood how to edit his address

-   Hesitated on the military base checkbox

-   Changes address and saves without issue.

I'd click on edit permanent address, and would...

-   Stopped at the checkbox about the military base outside the US

We're talking about the VA... who still lives on a military base? So that's the question I would raise. I can understand individuals who are veterans living outside the US, but not on a military base. Unless it's a spouse or dependent. I imagine that you could have a spouse who was married to another military member who's still in the service, but they're a veteran. But it's not obvious!

Changing the rest of the address, looks simple.

-   Would save permanent address.

-   Is surprised he could move forward without putting in an email.

### What if you don't see your device?

-   Very easily found more information component

-   Thinks that the information needs more clarity because he thinks that he wouldn't be able to reach his audiologist.

Finds the 'what if I don't see my hearing aid'

"Call your audiologist... ummmm... I don't know that you'd get through to an audiologist that easily. It would be more likely the audiology department and then you'd end up with a secretary or receptionist or somebody. And your audiologist might be tied up with someone, I suppose you could leave a message. I don't know what the VA's procedure is about what the audiologist can update. I don't know if it just needs more clarity or needs 'department' to ask your audiologist to update your file."

### Edit order on Review Page

-   Finds the edit button quickly but thinks it should be called 'add accessory' or similar

-   Would easily add the item and update the page

> Say you need to add accessories to your order...

I'd do the edit button... actually... that's not intuitive, to me anyway. You already had an accessory ordered. I would say while it is editing an original order that button ought to read 'Add accessory to your order' it's not a big deal and I think other people would figure it out eventually.

-   Would click the checkbox then update the page.

Follow up Questions
-------------------

> What kind of technology do you use regularly?

Cell phone (Samsung S10), computer (desktop), wife's desktop.

> Assistive technology?

Hearing aids, which connects to phone - "which can be scary sometimes because I want to share something with my wife, all the sound goes to my ears so she can't hear it. I can change that so she can hear it but it has caught me by surprise sometimes."

> Which device would you place you order on?

Desktop, always. Because it's a pretty good size screen (24") and it's clear and you can see everything. On a cell phone, it's small - I wear glasses (bifocals) and while it's not impossible or difficult, it's clearer and easier on the desktop.

> Would you use this over email?

Still prefers to do the email, because he doesn't have to navigate to it or login. "I just find my old email and resend it."
