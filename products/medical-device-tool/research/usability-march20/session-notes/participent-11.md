Participant 11
==============

Warm-up Questions
-----------------

> Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?

I come from a military and commercial airlines family. My family comes from Sweden. My grandfather came from one of the smaller Soviet Union countries. Anyway, my interest in aviation prompted me at one point to want to. become a naval aviation pilot. I applied and everything was fine until I fractured my ankle. I wound up being a helicopter pilot. Did a tour in Vietnam, just got home right as the man on the moon was making a landing. I spent two years in Iran training to fly helicopters. The second gulf war started and I came back [from Saudi Arabia] and managed a large helicopter company in the D.C. area so I left a condo and girlfriend of five years and went to Alaska. Been in Alaska since May of '85. I spent 8 years as a ski instructor. I still hold the record for the most volunteer hours. Loved it. [Stopped taking notes as participant continued]

> Can you tell me about your hearing aids?

Yeah, that was kind of problematic initially. When I first came to Alaska we had a brown card, similar with VA's healthcare system. Basically any vendor who would take a VA client. I've been denied, I went to test flight school in the Army and I spent all that time, oftentimes the ear plugs weren't adequate, so I had a lot of hearing loss working around turbine engines. I was also trained as an Army helicopter mechanic and so I had a loss of hearing that kept being denied with service connected. Of course my hearing was deteriorated but nothing was dealt with it until 10 years ago. I've done my research with consumer reports and other consumer links to see which provide the best one but I was always kind of, they were not quite up to bar. The tinnitus would get bad, like right now I can't do anything with my hearing aids because of this questionable effort to control the coronavirus. The one project they gave me, with is a tinnitus package with a speaker to override tinnitus was adequate in the beginning but it has a tertiary effect. There are better products out there but the process of becoming a VA vendor is very task-oriented for those who are making high technology hearing aids at a fraction of the cost for what is paid for by the VA. They're adequate but they don't feel the ditch of some hearing aids at a fraction of the cost. In Alaska, I've done some surveys of my own and Alaska is right on top there with one in New England and Midwest that have superior VA systems to address the needs of veterans. It's a great staff, they work well. I like the fact that they have a walk-in clinic. Often, basically if you show up on Tues/Wed/Thurs up until now you can get most of your needs taken care of and it's cost effective. The service is excellent. I'll shut up now.

> Have you ordered batteries through the VA?

Once you learn how to do it, it's a smooth process and it's prompt. I have two brands of hearing aids with one that's a backup. I once donated an obsolete pair. It's an easy process. Usually 5-10 business days I have my batteries and little cleaning tools. It's excellent.

> What method?

Uh, well there's several different ways. The easiest one is, sometimes the secure messaging. I can just go to audiology and tell them to order this. Or I can slip it in the mail, or I can go online. Or you can call. The automated call system is pretty good. You give them your name, social security number, and they have all that information. You say you need batteries and cleaning tools and it's done

> Which one do you usually use?

Usually it's easier for me to just call them. I don't think I've ever mailed. I call them or get online and tell them what I need. The people who handle the supplies are excellent. I imagine because of the restrictions that were placed on travel, I haven't experienced anything yet on wait times compared to calling into VA in Anchorage and trying to speak with somebody.

> What would make the overall experience better for you?

I was caught and I learned to rely on my noncommissioned officers because they're like nurses. My role was if you have a problem come to me, that's a difficult question to answer. I can't think of a better way to do it.

> How often do you place orders?

Well, they give a pretty generous supply so it varies anywhere between 3-6 months. It's pretty good.

> Where would you go to order hearing aid supplies from the VA online?

I was a reporter too and worked for a couple newspapers. Basically, I would search 'Online orders for hearing aid supplies'

> Have you participated in usability testing before?

No! Usually testing is done at a the VA in Anchorage. 

TASK 1
------

>  Can you show me how you would go about placing an order for batteries starting from this page?

Here on this big screen here, health care.. *hovers over health care* education... *scrolling down slowly* I'm searching for the connection that allows me to and I don't see it. It says Health care but... I'm not quite sure where to jump to. This is a brand new screen I've never accessed before. Let's try something different here. *Searches 'ordering va hearing aid supplies' into Google*. Okay here I am on Google. That's where I see it right now. How to order. It says you can use the blue VA form, which they enclose one of those when you get your batteries or they'll give you one when you go into town. You can order your batteries online via email.

> Can you hit the back button? If there was a way to do it on here, what would be your first inclination? 

Well, I think under Health care there should be another line saying 'How to order supplies' or something similar to that. Or 'how to order supplies' or 'how to order hearing aid supplies'

> Scroll to the top of the page. In this bar up top where would you first go if this functionality did exist on the site? 

I don't understand.

> At this point I'd just be leading you to the wrong place. I'm going to paste a link to the chat in Zoom.

TASK 2 
-------

> Take a moment to look over the page and let me know if anything's jumping out at you or is surprising at all.

Let's see... *scrolling down* Well, it's what I've been doing. I guess we're looking at the structure of this page and what jumps out at you. It's been my experiences with different learning disabilities where often pictures are great. So if you had a picture or cartoon... in Vietnam many of the people barely had any education. Some people didn't have the best reading skills or comprehension so the Army made these maintenance cartoons. You could fit them into your pocket and take them with you. So, one thing that is good about this website is that you have the blue shading. That focuses your attention. I think that's pretty good.

I would probably highlight how to order hearing aid supplies, and highlight by phone, by mail, or by form.

> What would you do next if you wanted to order batteries online?

If I wanted to order online... it's just a matter of going and ordering hearing aid batteries and accessories. You could click *clicks on the green button*

TASK 3
------

Here's where it would be difficult for veterans. Sign in or create an account. I've been around the block, it says try signing in with online order. Very few people know how to do. the DS Logon. You can sign in, let's see what happens. *Clicks on sign in*

>[  ID.me](http://id.me) will work and we won't be using your real sign-in. Whats your opinion of signing in at this point?

No, not difficult for me. I'm thinking of people I work with who have disabilities. One of the things, if I were to imagine a 26 or 28 year old Afghani vet and I looked at this, it would depend on the individual's psyche I guess. Today's veteran out in troubled areas rely heavily on sophisticated communications from Sat phones or satellite connected laptops. I think those individuals wouldn't have a problem with this. There are some older veterans who are 65 or older and some of them know how to use their smart phones pretty good and that's okay; I don't know what the degree of their computer literacy and capability is. If they have a smart phone, most of them know how to use a computer. A majority of veterans I know are pretty much Windows based. Me, I gave up on Microsoft operating software because too many problems with security and viruses and hijacking so that's why I went to a Macintosh.

> Go ahead and click on sign in. The blue button

*Participant clicks*

TASK 4
------

> For the remainder of the test, go through these pages as if you were ordering batteries or accessories.

*Participant scrolls down and clicks on the green button*

Yeah, it says Hector Smith up here! *clicks continue*

We'll use this address *Selects 'Send order to this address' on Permanent address 

*Scrolls down*

*Types in email address* 

Here we go Hector, we're gonna order you some supplies. 

*Clicks continue, clicks 'Yes, order batteries, selects first device, selects second device, continues*

Here's the confusing part. Accessories... required... they don't explain what accessories are. Let's say I do. Oh, okay, so, once you click... order this *selects first* order this *selects second, selects third, continues*

Order information... *Selects continue*

That's it, yeah. Your order's been submitted. I think it could be streamlined a little bit. For me, it's pretty straightforward

> What do you mean it could be streamlined?

It might be helpful to have all this on one page. Assuming nothing has changed regarding hearing aids, that might be easier.

> Okay. 

There's quite a few steps to go through and I'm not able to test if I put bad information is what is the feedback? I could see the possibility of error. So, maybe there could be a little note or a bright yellow caution for a review of your order and make sure the order is complete before sending the order. Amazon does that real well. Once you review it then you submit the order.

> Yeah, alright! What was your overall impression?

Very easy and very simple. I think it's a pretty decent system. Maybe I can speak for my associates or friends, I don't think. they'd have too much difficulty with this.

Extra tasks
-----------

[We didn't ask participant the extra task questions]

Follow-up Questions
-------------------

> What technology do you use regularly? 

I have all of them [laptop, tablet, phone]. I think your system could work with smart phone. I think your communication and technology software you're using is pretty good. I'm seeing my iMac screen duplicated on my iPhone XR.

> Do you have questions for me?

It may be off subject, but if the VA is going to find itself going towards this technology, maybe they could think about the possibility of those veterans who don't have any of this stuff that you and I have access to. Maybe they could get together with a manufacturer and here's a smartphone or inexpensive notebook or whatever. I see several advantages to doing that. What I find incredible is VHA and VPA don't communicate with each other.
