Participant 5: 
===============

Warm up Questions:
------------------

> Before we jump into the session, can you tell me a little about yourself? (If stuck, ask about service, location, occupation, etc.)

Oh boy. I'm US Army Veteran for 10 years. I went to work for the government as a civilian in military procurement. Our command bought everything that rolled, crawled, etc. I worked on tanks and computers and everything in between. And the standard procurement system, which is standard for ordering things.

> Can you tell me about your hearing aids?

I got them from the VA. I've been service connected for hearing since 1977, I wasn't given hearing aids until 2013, since I made too much money and my disability wasn't high enough. I get them from Cadillac Audio, they have been great in supporting them.

> Have you ever ordered hearing aid batteries through the VA?

Yes, I order them out of Arizona or Phoenix. I go online through benefits and order them through that system. Found out I couldn't order accessories, but then I was able to extract the information from the Cadillac and sent an email to DLC with make and model - I had them in a week. I bypassed the inability to send it online by sending it via email.

> What method do you use to order them?

eBenefits

> How has that experience been for you so far?

Great. I don't think about it.

> What would make that experience better for you?

One stop shopping would be nice. I wish accessories and batteries could be ordered like prescriptions through MyHealthevet.

> What does a typical order look like for you?

The new one... I used to order the domes, but then they decided that I needed the mold which is a permanent device. So now I just order a wax guard device that goes into the dome. I think it's 6 months of batteries at a time. I usually order them about 4.5 months. I've been ordering stuff in the military system since 1968.

> Do you usually add accessories to your order?

> Where would you expect to go online

I would go onto ebenefits and somewhere on that screen it says order hearing aid supplies...

If I wanted to order support equipment, I'd go on email and send it. I haven't needed new ones.

TASK 1:
-------

> Show me how you would go about placing an order, starting from this page.

I've never done it through[  va.gov](http://va.gov), always through ebenefits...

I'm trying to find a way to go to ebenefits, I guess it's underneath disability

I'd probably click on file for disability increase, because that would bring me to ebenefits.

> Is there anything on this page that you would click on?

I'd probably click on file for disability increase, because that would bring me to ebenefits, unless something has changed.

> Imagine that you didn't have to go to ebenefits 

-   Scrolls down to boxes

I don't see anything that would lead me to ordering hearing... it's always been a unique system.

-   Scrolls through the page

Nope I don't see anything that could... the rest is informational.

If I was in this situation right now, I'd do something in disability to go to ebenefits. There's nothing specifically towards hearing aids.

> /Moderator directs user to top of page/

I could click on VA Benefits and Health Care to see what that would give me...

> /Moderator directs user to click on health care/

Goes through the left side --- notes that it was the same stuff as the page.

AH FINALLY "Order hearing aids!"

> On a scale 1-10, how clear was the path to get to this page

0 --- simply because when I logged onto the screen, saw health care... [only] 'Refill and Track Prescriptions'. I'd put order hearing aid batteries under Disabilities column. I wouldn't poke around, I know another way to do it. I don't get why it's related to health care on the sunscreen, but not on the main screen. I don't get why it's a health issue when it's a hearing issue - disability related. In theory, it should be under Health Care [I think he means Disability]. I was looking under disability to take me to benefits.

--- Link ---

TASK 2: 
--------

-   Scrolled through the information

-   Notices phone

How can I do that automatedly?

I know what to do if they're not working right!

Only thing I see is this green button... 

-   Clicks on button

-   Reads through introduction screen

I'd click sign in or create an account, which would let me sign in.... If it would take me to ebenefits to order.

TASK 3:
-------

> What are your thoughts on needing to sign in?

Definitely! I don't want anyone ordering stuff for me that's not me. Besides if you don't log in, how do they know who to send it to?

TASK 4:
-------

-   Clicked order hearing aids

-   Clicked continue

-   Confirmed permanent and temporary, selected permanent

-   Reenter email

-   Continue

-   Yes, I need batteries

When I first saw "Select the hearing aids that need batteries" I thought I'd have to look at the ones they have on record... then I saw phonic which is mine. There should only be one per Veteran.  You're only supposed to have one pair at a time.

-   Continue

-   Yes I need accessories

Now this would be where you'd make the decision... depending on what you have I presume you'd 

I'm not sure if that's the one I use... but it should be populated based on my hearing aid

I'd have to call or email them saying that i's not accurate

Review

Contact information and all that stuff

..."Add batteries to your order"

..."Add accessories to your order..."

Completed

Submitted

Notices what he ordered and how long it will take to get it

I'd close out after this

That's one thing I didn't see...

> Anything missing?

I'm unable to click where this says print, but I'd also print.

> How would you print

Click print or go up and store it as a PDF and store it in my hearing aid folder on my system.

> Would you expect there to be a button?

I would expect that the "Print this page for your records" would open up the print screen...

Additional tasks
----------------

### Change address:

> You noticed a typo in your permanent address, what would you do?

I know I can do it in myhealthevet, but I would probably... oh what am I talking about - 

-   Clicks Edit

-   I'd just change it

-   And I'd save it.

> Is this what you expect to see?

Yes. I'd also expect that, if I change that address, that an email would be sent to my email that your address has changed. If I change anything in the system, I would expect to see an email on record. I would expect to be notified at my previously recorded email address of that change.

### Device missing:

> What if you don't see your device?

-   Finds the additional info component quickly

This is what I'd expect to have to do... I would have hoped that it would give me my audiologist's contact information.

Accessories more info is inappropriate because my audiologist is the one who determines the need. This should take me to my audiologist.

### Add accessory:

> Let's say that you remembered you needed to add an item to your order.

I'd hit the back button...

Oh I could also update it on review... this could work too the way you have it here.

This I think makes more work.

-   Clicks edit

Would change buttons...

This is new school and the way I do it is old school.

Follow up questions
-------------------

> What technology do you use regularly?

2 cell phones... I have an internet radio off of wifi... tablet, laptops (6) Dell XPS, Samsung Androids, Dell tablet

> Do you use any assistive technology?

I would love to use the bluetooth in my aids more than I do. My hearing aids are too old... I have to wear a panatech as a stepping stone. I do not wear anything around my body period. I'm waiting to get upgraded bluetooth hearing aids.

> Do you have any challenges with technology?

Not that I can't overcome, how about that?

> Can you tell me more about that?

I didn't have enough memory in my computer, so I saudered more RAM onto that.

> Do you enlarge the fonts on your phone?

On my cellphone, it's bigger than my wife's. I've got a big monitor.

I had cataract surgery a couple years ago. They put new lenses in and I wish I could see up close better.

> Would you use this ordering method?

Quite possibly... if I had an alternative, I would. I haven't had to order batteries in awhile, I have a lot on hand.

> Which method would you use?

If ebenefits is available, I'd use that. If I logged onto[  Vets.gov](http://vets.gov) and saw hearing aids, I'd say go for it!
