Participant 3:
==============

Warm up Questions:
------------------

> Can you tell me about yourself?

I am an Air Force veteran, separated after about 11 years of service. Director of music at a church, 2 semi-adult college aged children, husband, and dog.

> Tell me about your hearing aids?

My aids are Resound Quattro - I use them for crowds for tinnitus control.

> Have you ever ordered?

Yes, batteries and accessories.

> What method? 

Phone method.

> How is that for you?

Um, it's been alright. I would rather do it online, that way I don't have to wait on hold until someone can answer the phone.

> Is there anything else that would make the experience better for you, besides ordering online?

I can't think of anything. WELL, I'd like to be able to order online from a place I'm familiar with. Right now I go to 4 different places for things I need from the VA, which is the main reason I haven't ordered online because I haven't figured out how to do that yet.

> Where would you like that?

All medical stuff should go through MyHealthevet.

> Including hearing aid stuff?

Yes. Batteries, knee brace parts, etc. It makes sense, I can order prescriptions, talk to health care providers, but not supplies?

> When you place an order, what do you get?

Batteries and domes, I haven't needed anything else

> How often?

I'm thinking about every 4 months. My batteries don't last quite long enough for a 6-month order. I order all of my items at once - batteries and accessories.

------ share link ------ 

TASK 1: 
--------

> Can you show me from this screen, what you would do to place an order.

-   Navigated to 'VA Benefits and Health Care" in the nav bar because it says 'health care' 

-   Flowed into the Health Care section

-   Almost hit, 'View all in health care' but noticed the 'Order hearing aid batteries and prosthetic socks' link

-   Noted that she's been annoyed with ebenefits.

> How clear was the path to get this page?

Fine. I just don't think it's the page it ought to go to.

> Which page would you expect?

MyHealthevet because it deals with my health.

> Any surprises when navigating to this page?

Nope.

TASK 2: 
--------

> Look over this page and let me know if there's any info that jumps out at you.

It says I can order my batteries and accessories here, notes eligibility and ability to order by phone.

I'd click on the green button that says 'order hearing aid supplies'

> Which method would you use?

I'd click on the green button and order my supplies.

> Is there anything on this page that's surprising or confusing?

My question is if I click on a button, would I be transferred to eBenefits. This green button doesn't tell me if I'll be transferred to another site. I'd assume this button would take me somewhere where I wouldn't have to log in.

> What would you do next?

Click on the green button?

-   Pauses

This is where I'd stop, I would have had to log in by this point, I'd rather use the phone number. Too many passwords and logins.

> What do you mean by you'd already be logged in?

The first thing I do when I go to[  VA.gov](http://va.gov) is log on, next button should be order. Boom. This would have been at least two logins for me. (She misunderstands that she hasn't logged in already, making it only 1 login) It would make more sense to log in through MyHealtheVet.

>What would you do next?

I'd get annoyed that it says 30 minutes, first of all. I'd sign in with my healthevet.

> Could you tell me more about MyHealthevet?

I use it for everything health related. It's how I get all of my information. There are way too many veterans websites.

> For this test, we've populated your eligible products, but some of the items may have different eligibility dates if you've ordered those items. So go ahead and proceed through the form as you normally would.

Select the button order hearing aid batteries and accessories...

### Personal info

-   Pauses for a long time on personal info.

I would be confused about why this says 'Finish this application later

> What would you expect to say?

Finish this order later.

-   Clicks next

### Contact info

Would check my address. I'd be confused by this because this is on ebenefits? I was under the impression that I couldn't change my permanent address. I can't do that through[  VA.gov](http://va.gov). That would confuse me. Edit permanent address is not something you should be able to do that, unless I click this and it sends me someplace.

> What would make it more clear?

If I want to change my permanent address, I have to go through DEERS, which is part of benefits. I have to do it through the master site. I could see changing a temporary address here. Email address is fine because I logged in with one.

'Application' sounds like I'm applying for additional benefits.

> Imagine that you're going to ship to your permanent address. 

-   Has no trouble with selecting an address.

-   Asks if she has to re-enter an email address. 

-   Places address in.

-   Clicks next

### Batteries page

-   Paused on the battery page.

I see that I'm ineligible so I'll have to log back in on the 3rd which is annoying. Why can't I preorder and the order goes in on the 3rd. This would require me to log back in again on the third.

-   Clicks next

### Accessories page

Yes, I'd need accessories.

-   Recognizes the wax filters, selects it without problem. 

-   Notes that she'd be annoyed that she can't preorder unavailable accessories.

### Review page:

I can't add batteries anyway because of the date. This would end up putting someone in an infinite loop if they weren't paying attention.

### Confirmation page:

> What would you do now that you've completed the form

I would screen print this.

> Do you feel like there's anything missing from the page?

There should be a 1800 number, because not everyone has the ability to make a long distance call. Everyone else in the VA has a 1800 number.

I'd then look for a logout button, then check email as well to check for a confirmation.

I would print screen because things have been lost before. I would expect to get the email 1-2 days after the order.

I would like to have an email saying that the order had been electronically received, without the tracking information. 

-   Sees the email sent up top, wants that info down below as well.

>Let's say you noticed a typo, and you'd like to update it.

-   Finds edit without a problem

-   Saves it

> Is this what you expected?

I would expect this to change it throughout the VA's system, not just on this site.  I would expect to be directed to DEERS to update this. I would actually not want to update the permanent address here. I'd change it in DEERS and hope that it changes in this site as well. It might take awhile though.

> How would you save?

I'd click save.

> What would you do if you don't see the device you were expecting, what would you do?

I'd click the add info

This would take me to myhealthevet, because it allows me to communicate with my audiologist. I suspect this would take me to a phone number.

> Let's say you remembered you needed to add another accessory, how would you do that?

-   Finds 'Edit' quickly, then chooses the one she needs, and clicks update page.

> What are your thoughts about that process?

Makes sense, it's fine. If you forget something, it's nice to have it on this page instead of going back to the beginning.

Followup questions 
-------------------

> What technology do you use regularly?

Laptop (HP Envy), desktop, iPad, android phone.

> Do you use any assistive technology with those devices?

I'm not sure what that is, I guess not. I sometimes use a bluetooth headset to block out the sound in the room, but I have to take my hearing aids out to do it?.

> Do you have any challenges using devices?

No

>If you were going to use this method, which device would you use?

Probably my iPad because it's with me more often and the screen is larger and easier to maneuver than on a phone.

> Would you use the ordering method that you saw?

Only if it doesn't use extra logins. We have way too many logins on the VA.

No questions.
