Participant 9 
==============

Warm up Questions:
------------------

> Before we jump into the session, can you tell me a little about yourself? (If stuck, ask about service, location, occupation, etc.)

73, combat vet, living in Maryland.

> Can you tell me about your hearing aids?

This is my second set, first set broke. The left hearing aid has gone out. When they let us out, I'll go back and see if they can fix it for me.

> Have you ever ordered hearing aid batteries through the VA?

Yes

> What items do you order?

Batteries, ear tips, filters.

> What method do you use to order them?

Mail

> What is that process like for you? 

When you get anything they give you a blue card. When you need something, you fill out the card. You send it out and it shows up.

> How has that experience been for you so far?

Fine

> What would make that experience better for you?

I don't think so.

> What does a typical order look like for you?

> Do you usually add accessories to your order?

> Where would you expect to go online

I don't know that I can.

> Where would you try first?

I tried at one point, but I couldn't figure out where I was. I went to myhealthevet and looked around a little bit. I decided I'd just as soon mail it, because I thought it would be easier?

> Have you done usability before?

No

TASK 1:
-------

> Show me what you would do to order

I would sign in with MyHealtheVet.

-   Signs in with MyHealthevet

Everybody is so security-conscious! I gotta get a number to get into it..

> What do you think about that?

I'm not too happy about it. Everybody online has me do it... things like this. [Signing in with verification code.]

> Show me what you would do if you wanted to order hearing aid batteries and accessories, from this screen

-   Went to his profile dropdown

-   Went to VA Benefits and Health care

Uh I don't see anything there.

-   Browses links

Ok I found it

-   Clicks on Prescription Refills

-   Clicks on MyHealtheVet

> We're trying to get to the page about hearing aid batteries

Uh huh. 

-   Scrolls down through the prescription page

> What are you looking for?

Just looking. Just curious.

Ohh I see something that says order hearing aid batteries and socks... on the left there!

-   Clicks on the 'Order Hearing Aid Batteries and Prosthetic Socks' link

> How clear was the path to this page?

Pretty clear, yeah.

It's got me --- laughs --- it's telling me to go to ebenefits online.

I think it's good - it tells you how to order all of the things you want - you need.

> Any surprises?

Nope

--- Shares link ---

TASK 2: 
--------

> Take a moment to look over this page and let me know if any information jumps out at you about ordering supplies online.

-   Scrolls through the page slowly

Oh, interesting. It says that if I'm ordering batteries and accessories, it says I have to press 2 to speak with a customer service rep.

> Why is that interesting?

When I do it by mail, there's just one card that I use...

> Is there anything else standing out on this page?

Nope, it's got a lot of good information on it.

> Tell me more.

Well, if I go down, it says I can order by phone or by mail --- it doesn't say anything about ordering online.

> What keywords are you looking for, in relation to ordering online?

I'm looking at it. There's a green section that says 'Order hearing aid supplies' --- I guess that's how I'd go about it now.

> Go ahead.

-   Clicks on the button

> Take a moment to look over it and tell me what you'd do next.

-   Looks over the page relatively quickly

It says place an order... I don't see anyplace to put anything in...

-   Clicks sign in

TASK 3: 
--------

> What do you think about being prompted to sign in to place an order?

I think that's very helpful...

> Why?

Because there's a lot of words on the page, so I was looking at it and wondering what I do now. 

-   Tries to use HealtheVet

TASK 4:
-------

### Personal info

-   Clicks next

### Contact info

-   Notices steps at top of page - "Step 1 of 3 - ok."

I have a choice of 2 different addresses to send my supplies to

-   Selects one

-   Inputs email address again

-   Clicks next

### Batteries

-   Selects yes

"I'll order batteries for whatever that thing is!" (Doesn't recognize his old device)

### Accessories

-   Selects No

### Review

-   I'm on a page now where everything is populated...

-   Tries out adding items 

-   Does not click update to move forward

### Confirmation

Order is submitted, this is what I got and and where it's going

It says how long it will

This is great!

> Why do you think it's great?

I can proof read it

> What would you do now that you've submitted the order?

Close it down?

> Anything missing?

No

> How was that overall process for you?

Not difficult - I play on a computer all day. I'm fairly familiar with how to do things. If you were talking to my wife, it would be send me paper!

> Is there anything you can think of that would improve your experience?

No, it looks good!

Additional Tasks:
-----------------

### Change address:

> Imagine there's an error in your permanent address and you want to fix it...

I'd click on it - it says 'Edit Permanent Address' 

-   Clicks on it 

-   Makes edits

-   Saves quickly

> What did you think about the process of editing it?

I think it's wonderful. I've had to change my address in other forms this one's great and easy.

> Would you expect that address to update everywhere or just for this form?

Just for this form.

> Why?

I don't know where else it would go to... I guess I wouldn't mind if it updates everywhere.

### Device missing:

-   Clicks on 'What if I don't see my hearing aid?'

It says you need to contact your Audiologist. It even tells you how to contact it! I like it.

> What do you like about it?

It's not too many words. A lot of open space. It just walks you through the process.

> What would you expect to happen?

I would expect it would tell me where I need to go --- where the nearest medical center is. I like it.

---------- 

Oh that's interesting --- it says I can't order [item] until June 27!

> What do you think about that?

It's telling me what I can't do which is better than the whole thing just blowing up.

> Let's say that you don't see the accessory you need...

-   Opens the additional information component

It tells me where I can go if I don't see what I need.

> What do you think about that?

Anything that makes it easier to get to a person or whatever is great. All I have to do is hit the phone number. It's right there - I don't have to go to the[  VA.gov](http://va.gov) sheet and try to find it.

-----------

### Add accessories:

> Imagine you remembered you needed to add another accessory to your order.

Towards the bottom it says add accessories to your order... 

-   Clicks on edit

-   Selects items

-   Updates page

Hmmm... what does 'update the page' mean?

> What do you think?

Updates the old data with the new data?

> Was that what you expected to happen?

Yeah!

> Tell me more.

I'm not sure what the name of the accessories are. This would help me.

Follow up questions
-------------------

> What kind of technology do you use regularly?

I have a desktop computer.

> Do you have any phones or tablets?

I have a phone or tablet. If I'm doing anything official, I do it on my desktop.

> So if you were going to place an order, which would you use?

Desktop computer

> Why do you prefer the desktop?

The print's bigger and I can see it.

> Do you use any assistive technology?

No

> Do you enlarge the font on your phone?

No, I don't. If I did, I probably wouldn't be able to see anything.

> Why not?

Because it's so small to begin with.

> What phone do you use?

Samsung Galaxy 8

> Do you have any challenges using technology? 

Sometimes I don't have the most patience.

> What do you mean?

If I'm trying to get into a site and the load time is long, I'll get upset.

I found out lately in Microsoft Edge... that I have to use Google, because it doesn't work in Edge.

> What do you do when you encounter those kind of situations?

I go to the other browser.

> Would you use this ordering method?

Oh, yeah!

> Why would you prefer it over the other methods?

Well I don't write that well. When I send the card in, I'm not always sure they'll be able to read my writing.

> Have you had any problems with that?

No

> Any questions for me?

When will this go active?

I do all of my prescriptions online so y'know, it's what I'm used to doing, I guess.

> How did that form compare to how you order your other prescriptions online?

I see a screen and it will have several columns - one will be the product, when it shipped, how many refills you have left, and a box I can check.
