Warm up questions
-----------------

> Before we jump into the session, can you tell me a little about yourself? (If stuck, ask about service, location, occupation, etc.)

I was in the Army from 89 to 97 as a mechanic.

> Can you tell me about your hearing aids?

Um... I have a hard time seeing very small things. So changing the batteries in the hearing aids is like impossible for me.

> How long have you been using hearing aids

Since 96.

> Have you ever had to get a new set?

This is my third set. First set was stolen, second was damaged, this is my third set.

> How long have you had this set?

Going on 2 years.

> Have you ever ordered hearing aid batteries through the VA?

Yes

> What does that process look like?

I call them and a couple months later, I got them in the mail.

> It takes a couple months to get them?

That last time, yeah. It's pretty long.

> How has that experience been for you so far?

Ok I guess, I got my batteries.

> Is it typical that it takes a couple of months?

No.

> So it was just the one time that took awhile.

Yeah.

> What would make that experience better for you?

Maybe having them on hand where I can go get them at the VA.

> Tell me more.

That would be more convenient because I wouldn't have to wait, I could just go get them at the clinic.

> What does a typical order look like for you?

> Do you usually add accessories to your order?

No

> Where would you expect to go online

> How often do you place orders?

I order on the computer on MyHealtheVet. I'll send a message to audiologist and they order them for me. They refill them.

> How often do you refill?

About every 8 months.

> Have you done usability before?

No

> What sort of technology do you use regularly?

My phone, my digital TV and a tablet.

> What kind of phone?

Galaxy S10

> Do you use any assistive technology on those devices?

I put the biggest text on so I can see. I don't have any. Bluetooth devices.

> Do you have any challenges using computers or mobile devices?

Yes

> Tell me more about that.

Hearing is #1 and vision - I always have to use big text because of bad eyesight. When I don't have my glasses, I can't read at all. The Galaxy s10 has good speakers so I can hear pretty good with it as long as the volume is turned up.

> If you were gonna search for hearing aid batteries and accessories online, what kind of keywords would you look for?

Uhh... I don't know. "Batteries for hearing aids" maybe.
