Participant 7
=============

Warm up Questions:
------------------

> Before we jump into the session, can you tell me a little about yourself? (If stuck, ask about service, location, occupation, etc.)

> Can you tell me about your hearing aids?

This is a new set. I had Opticon and they gave me a new one that's PHONAK, I guess they're more powerful.

> Have you ever ordered hearing aid batteries through the VA?

Yes, that's where I get them. I order my batteries and accessories through the VA.

> What method do you use to order them?

I use the phone ordering.

> How has that experience been for you so far?

It worked out real well.

> Could you tell me more about that?

All I did was call the number and did my Social Security on the phone and it automatically came up and said the type of batteries... if that was correct, press pound or something. Then it said they're ordered and in the mail.

> What would make that experience better for you?

It was very easy to do.

> What does a typical order look like for you?

> Do you usually add accessories to your order?

> Where would you expect to go online

I didn't order on the computer, I got a card from the audology department with the phone number in Denver.

TASK 1:
-------

> For this task, I'd like you to imagine that you'd like to place an order for hearing aid batteries on this website.

Oh I would probably use the search!

> Show me what you would do!

-   Searched 'hearing aid batteries'

-   Waited for it to load

-   Skipped recommended link

-   Clicked on second link

> On a scale from 1-10, how clear was the path to get to this screen?

Took me some time.

> Could you tell me more?

It took me a lot of time to search through and find the correct scheme to get down to the batteries and then I have to go sign into benefits. So it takes quite a while to use it online.

> How would you expect to find this page?

I would expect to see a link...

TASK 2:
-------

> Does anything jump out at you about ordering batteries online?

I see a green box that says 'Order hearing aid supplies and it also gives me a phone number to call Denver.

> Of these ordering options, which one would you choose?

Aside from the icon to click on, there's phone and mail and a download form link for a hard copy.

> Could you show me what you would do to place an order for batteries?

From this screen, I'd probably go straight to this green button that says order

Then it wants me to sign in...

TASK 3:
-------

> What are your thoughts about needing to sign in to place an order?

It gives me DS Login or MyHealthevet or ID.me and you can create one. I always use MyHealthevet

> How do you feel about needing to sign in?

It makes it so much more difficult. It's easier to call in by phone. It's just a lot of work navigating from page to page, then I have to sign in. I've never done it this way before, so...

TASK 4:
-------

> Show me what you'd do next to place an order

I'd have to go ahead and sign in... with MyHealthevet.

Now it clicked over to Order hearing aid batteries and accessories with the same green icon.

> Proceed to place an order and talk me through your thoughts.

Uh... ok.

### Personal information

It's got personal information for a 'Hector Smith'... ok.

-   Hit continue

### Contact information

-   Skips addresses

-   Reenter email by copying text and pasting.Â 

### Batteries

Now it's taken me ... "do you need to order hearing aid batteries?" Yes.

It says I can't order batteries for this device until [date].

-   Selected the secondary device

-   Hit continue

### Accessories

-   Selected does not need accessories

-   Continued to review page

### Review

I'm in the final screen and just making sure that address and everything is filled out

-   Seems to understand purpose of page and how to edit

It says complete your order...

-   Clicks button

### Confirmation

Ok, order has been submitted.

> What would you do now that you have submitted the order?

I would sign out and close the window

> Is there anything missing from this screen?

Uh...

> What do you think about the ordering form that you just submitted?

I'd say that it's real difficult. It seems repetitious about ordering accessories and it just seems like there's a lot of screens to go through. I don't know why it's asking for accessories, I'm trying to order batteries. It just keeps repeating.

> What do you think would be helpful for you in placing an order

Helpful for using this website? I doubt that I would use it, I find the telephone a lot easier.

> Do you see the back button in your browser?

...

Additional Tasks
----------------

### Change address:

> Show how you would edit your address

There's an icon that says edit your permanent address.

-   Reads the checkbox first

No... ok that's all filled in.

-   Saved the address without problems.

### Device missing:

> Let's say that you want to order batteries, but you don't see the device you want to order batteries for.

-   Finds the add'l info 'icon'

I'd need to call the audiologist to update my record

> What do you think about that?

That would be difficult with all of the stuff you have to do with the VA to get through to your audiologist

> Can you tell me more?

It does say that I can find contact information - that would help me find the number for the audiology and I could call em up.

### Add accessory:

> Let's imagine that you forgot to add an accessory to your order. What would you do to add one?

-   Scrolls around

There's an icon [button] to edit accessories. I would click on that icon.

-   Clicks edit button

> How would you add one of these accessories?

I would put a checkbox in the box and update the page.

-   Selects the checkbox button and saves

Follow up questions:
--------------------

> What technology do you use regularly?

Laptop, phone, I've got a streamer for my hearing aids for the TV.

> What kind of cell phone do you have?

A Galaxy S7
