Participant 4:
==============

Warm up Questions:
------------------

> Before we jump into the session, can you tell me a little about yourself? (If stuck, ask about service, location, occupation, etc.)

Retired, in the navy 4 years. I did not enroll in VA healthcare until I got close to retirement from my regular job and I needed healthcare. I've been enrolled in VA healthcare for 12 years. I was married with children and I live alone in my own home. I'm 73.

> Can you tell me about your hearing aids?

I got them through the VA for about 11-12 years. I was surprised at the difference they made. I don't wear them all the time, I wear them with friends and when watching television. I have an accessory that I got through the VA that broadcasts audio from the TV to my hearing aids, which has been helpful. I normally do not have them on. I have hearing, but they make things better in certain situations.

> Did you get the streaming device from the VA?

Yes, I did. This is my second set of hearing aids. 3 or 4 years ago, I contacted the aud dept in indianalopis to get my hearing checked again because the aids weren't as effective as they used to be. They checked and said they could order new hearing aids that would work better. They ordered them and I got them. I mentioned at the time that my hearing was still muffled while watching TV - that I couldn't hear the dialogue. They said that if it didn't work out, they could send it back.

> Have you ever ordered hearing aid batteries through the VA?

That's interesting - I just ordered some a little over a week ago by email. It was the first time I've ever done that. It's the first time I've ordered batteries since they gave me so many originally. I got an email that they'd be showing up any day now. They told me about the new procedure for ordering.

> What did the email look like that you sent them?

They just wanted me to confirm my name, mailing address, and last 4 of my social. I believe that went to Denver.

> What method do you use to order them?

[Email, later says he might've called]

> How has that experience been for you so far?

No trouble at all.

> What would make that experience better for you?

Not necessarily. A phone call might be an alternate. By email, I know they're getting all the info that they need - no question about if they got the right numbers or anything.

> What does a typical order look like for you?

This was my first time ordering, so I'm not sure how many batteries they will send. I think they send - I don't really remember - a 6 month supply? They may be in my mailbox as we speak. Haven't checked.

> Do you usually add accessories to your order?

[He has only ordered batteries regularly. Has ordered a TV extender through his audiologist]

> How often do you place these orders? 

[Has only placed them once. Expects 6 months of supplies, but doesn't use many batteries.]

> If you were to do so right now, where would you go to order hearing aid supplies from the VA online?

If I was going to order batteries right now, I would probably go back to the email that I got from them and look into the new procedure that they prescribed. Since I haven't used it yet, I'm not sure exactly how it works. I assume there's something that I download to my phone or computer to use the new procedure, but I don't recall. I haven't looked at it in depth.

> Lastly, have you participated in usability testing before? 

--

> How'd it go?

TASK 1: 
--------

-   Scrolls down

"I see Sees prescription, but it's not a prescription, I believe... um, it's not a prescription, but it seems like it's the closest to what I'm looking for. But it doesn't seem like it will be right. Nothing else on here seems to apply for what I want, just yet."

> What are you looking for?

Batteries. Some way to order batteries.

I would probably click prescription to see if that steers me in the right place. Let me go ahead and do that.

-   Scrolls past the navigation bar and reads the prescription page.

It's clear about the prescriptions but I'm not seeing anything just yet about ordering batteries. Everything on here refers to prescription, and I don't think that batteries are a prescription, but it still seems like this might be the place to go.

It does say I need to have one of these three accounts and I do have myhealthevet premium version.

I don't know. I just --- I see no indication for reordering batteries on this page. I might do a search on the top of the page. 

-   Scrolls up and searches 'hearing aid batteries'

Alright, now we're getting somewhere. Top recommendation comes up 'Order Hearing aid..' 

-   Proceeds to read all of the links.

Yeah... going to this section is giving me some links to order batteries. I see several --- several options. Umm... 

-   Hesitates for awhile before clicking the top recommendation, which is the intended destination.

-   Notes he has to sign into benefits

-   Notes that healthevet and[  id.me](http://id.me) won't work

> How clear was the path getting to this page?

Well I kept digging but didn't find what I want. I had to use search to find this page. It's telling me I need a DS logon account, and I don't know what that is. If I wanted to order batteries right now, I'd have to do some digging.

> What would have been more helpful to find this page?

When I first got to --- a couple pages back --- in addition to ordering prescriptions, if there was a separate link for ordering hearing aid batteries and apparently prosthetic socks (I'm not sure what those are). If there was a link back then, it would have been more clear to me.

TASK 2:
-------

> Show me what you'd do to order accessories...

-   Scrolls down and reads the eligibility information... says he qualifies with all of the requirements

-   Notices ordering by phone

-   Scrolls down through the more information section

> Is there anything jumping out at you about ordering online?

-   Backs up through the page

It says I can order by phone, by mail... not seeing anything about ordering online.

> What are you looking for on this screen?

Um.. ordering hearing aid batteries. Which I see. And it says I can order batteries and accessories right now. Says I can order by phone and it says it can order by mail.

> Is there anything above?

No, there's a box that says ordering hearing aid supplies... let me click that. Aha! Ok I had to click that box to get here. On the previous page it showed ordering by phone and by mail. It seems like this should be on the previous page as well. I wouldn't have automatically pressed that box unless you suggested me to. But I see here that I can order... sign in or create an account...

> What would you do next to place an order?

I would sign in. It says sign in or create an account. Uh... it says you need your shipping and email address... and hearing aid information... um.... Probably need to figure out what they want by 'hearing aid information'

But I also know what batteries I use. But without...

TASK 3:
-------

-   Clicks sign in or create an account.

I would sign in with my healthevet account

> What are your thoughts about being asked to sign in to place an order?

I have no problems with this myself. Sounds legitimate. So not anyone can come on and order. I have to show that I am indeed a vet.

TASK 4:
-------

-   Noticed grey box on auth page.

-   Clicked green box

-   Looked over, confirmed the personal info

-   Hit continue

-   Understood permanent and temp address, selected one without issue

-   Enters in his email address without issue.

I confirm my address and email so they can send me a confirmation email...

-   Hit continue

-   Said he needs batteries

-   Pauses when he sees the devices "It's not my machine... ok"

-   Understands that those are his devices and orders for the most recent one

-   Hit continue

-   Hits yes on accessories

I'm reading what accessories are available...

-   Doesn't seem to get the items

I think I know what these items are, but I'm not certain.

-   Has no problems selecting.

-   Notes that the last accessory isn't available online til June.

### Review page:

-   Scrolls up and down and then slowly reviews...

Add batteries to your order... I thought I already ordered batteries, but uh...

> What would make that more clear?

Well let me back up a little bit... "Add Batteries to your order" oh ok... "you have requested to receive batteries for the following hearing aids." Well it says that I already requested it so I don't need to order anymore... so it's asking if I need them but it's also confirming that I have these on my order.

> Is there anything confusing about that section?

Batteries. Select your supplies.... Add batteries to your order... Edit....

Um... no. At this point, I would hit continue, as it's confirming that I'm ordering.

-   Hits continue

OH ok, your order has been submitted, we'll send you an email. Batteries and domes.

> What would you do now that you've completed the form?

Umm... probably exit out of this page. Because I should be receiving a confirming email as well which should have all of the appropriate information on there. I have a question --- you had me log in under[  ID.me](http://id.me) - is that just for this exercise? I would normally log in under MyHealthevet.

> Do you feel like there's anything missing from this page?

No. It just - no, it's ok. Seems like it took awhile to go through there, but it's the first time I've used it. On the [review] page, it wasn't quite clear to me that I wasn't adding stuff... seemed like an extra step that didn't need to be there.

Additional Tasks:
-----------------

Skipped as we ran out of time.

Follow up questions
-------------------

> What tech do you use regularly?

My cellphone usually. Surface computer that I'm using now, secondly. I do a fair amount on my phone. I do order prescriptions through the VA, which I've never tried to do through my phone. I'm not sure that I can go on myhealthevet on my phone.

> Do you use any assistive technology.

Just hearing aids. I don't use anything on the phone for hearing or vision, if that's what you're asking me.

> Do you have any challenges using computers or mobile devices

No, just a slow typist.

> Would you use the ordering method you just saw?

I probably would. It looks like it would be a simple way to go about it. Instead of sending an email - instead of--- well I could call. And I might've called when I ordered these last ones. I didn't really think about it. I forgot how I got there. It was the first time I ordered batteries myself. The last set came when I got something serviced... when it came back, they included batteries.

> What device would you place orders on?

This surface desktop computer that I'm on right now.

> Why would you prefer that method?

I just think it would be easier to navigate on this than on my phone... for this particular order process.

> Any questions for me?

No.
