# Research Plan for BAM2, Medical Device Tool, March 2020
(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 

## Goals
1. What product & team are you doing this research for? <br>
**Benefits & Memorials 2**

2. Background: <br>
**This product is a migration and modernization of the hearing aid battery ordering functionality that currently exists as an iframed applet on eBenefits, with the new feature of ordering accessories. With eBenefits being sunsetted and the DLC’s interest in increasing adoption of online ordering to reduce contact center workload, we’re tasked with designing a modernized online ordering experience that will be easier for Vets and less overhead for the DLC.**

3. Research questions:
    - Do Veterans understand that batteries and accessories will be ordered on separate pages?
    - Do Veterans understand selecting and deselecting the product cards?
    - Where do Veterans expect to find the order form on VA.gov? 
    - Do Veterans know who they can contact with questions about their order?
    - Do Veterans feel confident about the steps after an order is placed? 
    - Are there any gaps in the order process?
    - Do Veterans feel prepared when beginning the form?
    - Is the ordering process intuitive for Veterans?
    - Is it clear how to edit a prefilled address or add a new temporary address?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 
    - Veterans may struggle to locate the content page and form link
    - Veterans may not understand that adding accessories to their order happens after adding batteries
    - Veterans may have concerns about receiving an email notification after submitting an order 
    - Veterans may want to print out the review submission screen to have a 'receipt' displaying their ordered items
    - Veterans may miss the 'add an email address for an order confirmation' component 


## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? <br>
**45-minute remote, task-based usability study with Veterans who order hearing aid resupply.**
  
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? <br>
**We are choosing this research method because we are conducting usability testing and need to validate that the design is intuitive as Veterans place orders for hearing aid batteries and accessories. We will guide participants through tasks using a test account in the tool's staging environment to help uncover successes and pain points in the ordering process. 
<br><br>
Additionally, we want the staging environment to be as close as possible to how the participant would actually place an order; we have validated with DLC that they will provide the hearing aid batteries and accessories for each participant so the test accounts can be prepped beforehand. Note: There will _not_ be any PII displayed.**

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? <br>
**Online, via Zoom.**

4.	What will you be testing? <br> 
**We will be testing the staging environment of the hearing aid resupply ordering form on VA.gov.**

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
    - **We would like to interview 8-10 Veterans who order hearing aid batteries through the VA.**<br>
    - **Note: Participants _must_ be comfortable providing at least 1 of the following identifiers: Last four numbers of SSN or Date of Birth. This information, in addition to their full name, will be sent to the DLC so each participant's order data can be populated in testing accounts prior to each session. No PII will be displayed in the testing accounts.**
      - In order to reach the desires number of participants, we would like Perigean to schedule 15 participants total, with the expectation that a max of 7 no-shows
      - At least 5 pre-9/11 Veterans
      - At least 5 post-9/11 Veterans
      - Include a mix of Veterans with a disability rating of 80% or higher
      - Include a mix of male and female Veterans
      - If possible, 1-2 Veterans who have a cochlear implant

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? <br>
**We plan to leverage Perigean to recruit Veterans to this study.**


## When? 
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? <br>
**April 15, 2020 - April 20, 2020**, research plan / conversation guide submitted to Lauren Alexanderson by April 6, 2020.


2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? <br> 
**The staging environment will be fully functional by April 10th**

Non-clickable mockups can be found here: https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/6MVTG94WNH5 

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? <br>
