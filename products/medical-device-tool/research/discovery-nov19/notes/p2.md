# Veteran with Hearing Aid Interview

_B-P3, Monday December 9, 2019 at 9:30am ET_


**I’m just confirming if you’re comfortable if I record my screen as we talk today.** <br>
Yes

**Can you tell me a little about yourself?**<br>
I’m an Air Force veteran. I’m currently a [job title]. I have two kids in college. My husband works over in [job location]. And I have a dog that might bother us when we’re talking. 

**Can you tell me about your experience with technology?**<br>
I used to, my Air Force job I was a physicist and a scientist and I did a lot of software development for satellite design and (etc). I have extensive computer knowledge. 

**Do you use a computer now or mobile devices?**<br>
Every day

**Do you have any challenges?**<br>
I think the biggest challenge in using mobile devices is the fact that it’s sometimes hard to find things. When you’re on the computer you can pull up the menu or the site map it’s pretty easy to locate what you’re looking for. Because a phone in particular is smaller, they tend to crunch things all together so you cant find what you’re looking for. I don’t have that problem on my iPad as much because it’s a bigger screen, but phones tend to consolidate things into too small of a space

**What do you encounter?**<br>
Partly, I have a newer phone now so I’m able to use the pinch and screen method to get the screen bigger to locate exactly what I’m looking for. I’ve gotten good at finding the button that says search. Once you et there you’re okay

**Can you tell me about your hearing aids?**
Right now, I’m a musician as well so I use my ears every day. I found that I had some high pitch hearing loss in one of my ears. The real problem is I’ve had tinnitus since my mid twenties when I was on active duty. We’re using these to try to alleviate my tinnitus symptoms. I wear them all day and I use them especially I use the hearing part of it in crowds because my high pitch hearing. Amplifying the sound helps with hearing loss

**Challenges?**
I think the biggest challenge I face with my hearing aids that I wish they had more selections. That sounds very first world. My husband has an old hearing aid and it turns on and off. Mine has settings for different things. If I’m in a crowd I’m in one setting, (talking fast, missed some words). I control everything with my phone. I can pull up my phone and set it once I’m in a restaurant, which has a different environment from being outdoors. The second thing is I have both an Android phone and an iPad, I’m weird I know. They operate differently on the Android and iPad. They’re much more connected and fluid and functional on the iPad. On the Android the bluetooth can drop occasionally. They’re telling me they’re working on the software and I tell them if Apple got it right you can too. 

**Have you ever ordered hearing aid batteries through the VA?**<br>
I have, but I can’t order them online. I found that out because my husband is retired Air Force. I have not retired; I have a disability rating. So when I log on I’m connected to my husband’s account and I couldn’t create my own account because of my email, so I couldn’t order online. I use the phone system and order through Denver. 

**Where did you order from?**<br>
eBenefits or something, I wrote it down. They said you already have an account when I tried to create an account with my personal email. I got my password reset, logged in, and it turns out it’s my husband’s retired connection. It wouldn’t let me use my SSN to get to my half of the benefits page. I’ve never had to use the online benefits so this summer when I tried to use the hearing aid benefits I didn’t know what to do. I can’t be the only VA beneficiary who’s also a military dependent. So, I cant figure out how to make that happen. 

**How did you originally learn about the medical resupply benefit?**<br>
When I went in to get my hearing aids they gave me a packet of information. It came with the phone number, how to take care of your hearing aids, and reorder. About a month before you run out of batteries you want to be sure to reorder them. I put all of that information in the contact thing in my phone.

**Do you have any doubts about how your benefit works?**<br>
No, they were very clear when they explained it to me. I had to go in and get something adjusted and the technician explained the process better than the doctor did. The technician was fabulous and explained about the phone thing. I didn’t know until then that I could do it online. 

**The option’s there, but there’s a hurdle for you specifically. The way she explained it, or the benefit, was that you could do it through the phone?**<br>
Yes

**How would you describe the benefit to other veterans?**<br>
Well, I’ve had to describe it a couple of times. One of my classmates from college was talking about how he was going to have to get hearing aids and how expensive they were, and I said, “Have you gone to the VA yet” and he said no because in the past it was hard to get a hearing aid appointment. So, I talked him into going down and getting a hearing appointment and it took a couple weeks to get an appointment but they fitted me with new hearing aids that connected to my phone and they were so much easier to use than I thought they would be. So he went down and… (speaking fast, couldn't keep up)

**What do you think about the benefit?**<br>
It’s over the top, it’s fabulous. It was one thing you go to Walmart or Target and right next to the checkout is hearing aid batteries. Honestly, when I first got the hearing aid it kinda popped into my head how much it costs. I also originally asked about rechargeable ones and the technician said for most of her patients she didn’t recommend them because they don’t have as strong or as long a battery life as they should for a full day of use. So she convinced me to use the one with the batteries and said don’t worry about it they’re resupplied. So from then beginning I knew I’d be covered but I was worried before she explained it to me

**Is there any way to better fit your needs?**<br>
I think because I have an account on My HealtheVet that’s how I order my prescriptions, I hit, submit, and they mail it to my house. I don’t know why the batteries can’t be ordered the same way. You get x number of refills a year and you need wax guards, you need all these pieces, so why not have them all on the site. It seems like an extra step to call a phone number to Denver. I assumed Denver was for me because I’m in [State]. I don’t know why I can’t order them online. Even when I click to order on eBenefits it still sends me to My HealtheVet. Have one place for your medical care.

**I know you said you tried to go on eBenefits and you weren’t able to, but you found out you could order through the phone. Do you order through the live agent or automated?**<br>
You can only order batteries through the automated system. If you need wax guards or dome you have to talk to a human. If you should be able to do an automated thing, you should be able to order the dome and the wax guards. When I first called they said I have a 45 min wait. But if you want to put your phone number in they’re call you back, which was great because I didn’t want to sit there listening to horrible music. It wasn’t 45 min it was more like 20. It would be great if there was a system to get everything you need. By the time you need batteries you also need those other things so why not do it at the same time?

**Can you describe what your typical order might look like?**<br>
I get the 6 month supply of batteries. I ask for the 6 month supply of wax guards. The little plastic domes that go on the top are really really fine, which is good, but they tear easily. I get a package of those so I have a replacement. 6 month supply of each of those things. 

**Does your order ever change?**<br>
It hasn’t 

**How do you recall the details of the items?**<br>
They wrote it down for me when I first got my hearing aids. These are the things you get replaced every 6 months. How to clean it and everything like that.

**How long does it take on average?**<br>
Like I said when I called in and it said I have a 45 min wait I gave them my phone number and 25 min later they called and the phone call lasted 3 maybe 4 minutes. They asked what I need and I said batteries, wax guards, and domes and they said all right and went through SSN and everything and said they’d be on their way

**Where do you feel this experience falls short?**<br>
I think that it falls short in the fact that I wish I could have been able to do it online because that day I ordered medication so I wish I could do it through My HealtheVet. I wish I could order everything I need, not batteries. When I get my medications through the mail I get a tracking number. I don’t get a tracking number through phone. I don’t know when they’re gonna come, usually it’s 2-3 weeks, but I don’t know because there’s no tracking number.

**Ways experience is good?**<br>
The fact that I can get them is good. I was very surprised that they were going to supply those as well because you don’t get that through other, if I had to get these through another insurance I wouldn’t get my batteries for free. I think it’s good in that I can contact that phone number. It’s obviously a slow one but they’ve found a way to make it quicker and less stressful on the person calling in. But as I said I think the whole process seems pretty quick, uhm, and I get them, they’re ready. If I need something immediately I know that they’re products I can pick up at Walmart and for some reason I can pick the same one on Walmart. If I run out of wax guards I can run down (to the VA) and they can give me a couple. I’m fortunate because I live in a city that has a VA. I know for people living outside of the city that would be far more difficult. 

**Is there any reason you might prefer to order over phone?**<br>
Ordering via phone would be fine especially if I had a question. You know, “I’m running out of wax guards too fast, can I get them sooner” is something I could ask over the phone. 

**How long has it taken to receive your orders on average?**<br>
About 2-3 weeks 

**Do you feel like that’s reasonable?**<br> 
Uhm, well, no. I can drive to Denver in 6 hours so I don’t understand why, but I get it’s a government thing. But it doesn’t seem to make sense why wait 2-3 weeks, ti seems you push the button and someone puts the batteries and stuff in the box it shouldn’t take that long to get mailed. I don’t know if this is the only place that does this for all Veterans so I get how it can be slow. 

**Have you received communication?**<br>
None

**How would you prefer to receive communication?**<br>
I’d like to know it’s coming. My email and everything is connected. I get text messages for my appointments, I get email reminders for my medications and appointments. When it gets shipped I should get a text message or email. I don’t need a tracking number as long as I know it’s on the way. I checked my email this morning and I got an email from the VA that my prescriptions are on their way. That way I know they’re shipped and they’re coming this week. Especially if you’re waiting for something for two weeks, it would be nice to know. I er on the side of 6-8 weeks in advance to order. 

**Have you ever encountered any problems with ordering and shipping?**<br>
Just the ones I’ve already indicated. You usually have to wait online, and wait to get them. Not getting them, no that hasn’t happened. I’ve always gotten them.

**How would you go about solving?**<br>
I guess I’d call the number and say, “hey, I ordered on this date and I haven’t received them yet. Do I get new ones?’ If I get desperate, I can go to Walmart. But if I need wax guards I could go to the walk-in VA clinic. Because there isn’t communication, it’s one way communication. I contact them. I don’t get feedback communication. 

**Have you needed to return?**<br>
No 

**If you did, how would you initiate?**<br>
They send a label in the box that you can stick back on there and mail it back. They even send an envelope with a little blue card that has what you need on it so you can mail it in. That’s another option. I’ve never used the mail in option 

**Why not?**<br>
My birthday says I’m a boomer, but I’ve been contacted to technology since college so for me it’s just as fast. We pay our bills online, we do everything online. I mail birthday cards. I don’t think of popping something in the mail.

**What do you think about ordering batteries online?**<br>
I wouldn’t have a problem ordering them online. I am comfortable with it. I could tell you, my in-laws would be horrible with it. But I don’t have a problem with it

**Any concerns about ordering online through the VA?**<br>
No, I have no concerns getting my medicine through the VA. The sites are secure, I use secure passwords, so I would not at all be concerned 

**How would you find out about the benefit online?**<br>
I receive the e-news letter through the VA about what’s coming up and notices through an inbox message through My HealtheVet. I’m on social media but the VA tends to get buried in social media. It’s not one of the top pages that comes up. I guess they don’t pay enough money to get them to pop up high enough. Occasionally I see things on social media. I have a couple subscriptions to VA program newsletters through the DA and woman’s Veterans organizations where they share current information and things coming up. That’s originally how My HealtheVet came up. I think through emails and newsletters is how I would find out. And at the VA there’s something with the latest information. 

**Where would you go to order hearing aid batteries online?**<br>
Well if I could, I would do it through HealtheVet. The only source I know about is eBenefits site

**If you had to search, what search terms?**<br>
Uhm, “Veteran hearing and benefits” would be the first. 

**Is there anything else you’d like to share with us?**<br>
I think the biggest thing is that the VA should have a single stop. It’s become very obvious that there’s a benefits site, and a HealthyVet site, and somewhere they need to connect. You need separate logins for both, separate registrations for both. There are veterans of a certain generation who will never do that. As veterans from current active duty they’re going to want to be connected, but there’s too many stops. At least at the top level to filter down to the others. 

**Do you have any questions for me?**<br>
So, your goal is to eventually develop a way to make this more streamlined? Is that why?

**Yeah, we’re trying to learn a little more about the pain points that exist to improve the process**<br>
Cool
