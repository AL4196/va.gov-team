### Outcomes & Feedback
As the design team worked, we uncovered some gaps in our knowledge that we needed answered.

#### Presenting to the team:
- For the sake of consistency and technical simplicity, the team agreed to pursue concepts *without* dashboard-like functionality.
- Discussion was had around whether or not to have more generic content and single ordering form for all devices or to have distinct content pages and ordering forms for each product type.

#### Presenting to the DLC:
- DLC stakeholders liked the concept shown to them (Option 3), and gave us more information to help us refine the concept:
  - Veterans are able to have up to 5 authorized HA devices attributed to them, in the case of having two different aid types in use at once or having backup devices.

#### Check-in with VSP IA:
- It was recommended by the IA/Content team to split up the current DLC offerings of batteries/accessories and prosthetic socks into distinct pages to preserve information scent and SEO value.
- It was noted that a higher level content page may not be necessary with only two product lines being offered currently, but that this may be added in the future.
