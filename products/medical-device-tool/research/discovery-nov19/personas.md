# Personas<br>
This document serves to house the first draft personas created through MDT Discovery's synthesis. Each persona contains relevant user scenarios. 

## William<br>
William is a Gulf War-era Veteran who has been wearing hearing aids from the VA for years. William has mild hearing loss and severe tinnitus from his service, so he prefers to wear his hearing aids all day to treat his symptoms. Generally, William prefers to use private insurance for most of his healthcare over the "hassle" of VA care, but utilizes the hearing aid benefit to save money. He is comfortable with general internet application usage across his computer, tablet, and phone (in a pinch!)

### Frustrations<br>
- Having to change batteries too often
- Needing to manually order the same things repeatedly
- Ordering batteries and the accessories requires an agent, which sometimes has a 45 minute wait
- Not knowing the status of his order until it arrives
- Wanting rechargeable, higher tech hearing aids; feeling that the VA is behind in product offerings
- Logging into multiple systems with different passwords that need changed periodically
- Not being able to order online because he couldn't get into eBenefits

### Goals<br>
- Spend less time and energy ordering his regular resupply
- Be informed about the movement of his order via email
- Learn about potentially getting rechargeable aids
- Order online

### Scenarios<br>
- William is running low on his regular resupply order and wants to place the same order as last time.
- William is running out of batteries more quickly and needs to get a resupply sooner than usual.
- William was given a cleaning solution by his clinic, but has run out. He wants to find out about getting more.
- William has been fitted with a new pair of hearing aids and needs to order new resupply for the first time.

## Luke<br>
Luke is a Vietnam-era Veteran who has had a hearing disability rating for decades, but only recently began using the VA's hearing aid benefit. Although the hearing aids are helpful, he finds them uncomfortable so doesn't wear them all the time, inadvertently preserving the lifespan of his resupply. He is not confident using technology, and prefers using a flip phone over learning how to use a smart phone. However, he uses VA Healthcare services heavily and has learned to order prescriptions online through My HealtheVet. He thinks the audiologist technicians at VA clinics are extremely friendly and helpful. Luke orders batteries from the VA with the mail card, and does not know of other ways to order.

### Frustrations<br>
- Needing to reference packaging in order to remember order items
- The mailer card not coming pre-filled with his order details
- Not being sure if or when his order was received
- Not being able to order hearing aid batteries through My HealtheVet when he's already ordering prescriptions there
- VA.gov navigation being too complicated

### Goals<br>
- Order medication and batteries in the same location (preferably through My HealtheVet)
- Order in a way that doesn't require him to manually fill out a form
- If he needs to order online, it needs to require minimal cognitive effort

### Scenarios<br>
- Luke is ordering resupply for his new hearing aids for the first time.
- Luke is filling in the mail-in card but lost his battery packaging and cannot remember what type he orders.
- Luke has taken his hearing aids out for the day due to pain, but he would like assistance with his order.
- Luke has run out of postage stamps and needs to find another way to place an order for batteries.
- Luke attempted to order new batteries but noticed the incorrect ones are listed in his profile.

## Jacob <br>
Jacob is a post-9/11 Veteran who experienced hearing loss and traumatic leg amputation during his service. He has recently been provided rechargeable hearing aids and a leg prosthesis. He was originally against hearing aids due to the way they looked, so he is happy to have the in-ear aids. Recently, he has found the aids are dying so quickly that he's unable to use them as often as he needs. He is very comfortable using technology and prefers to do all of his tasks online if possible, but hasn't been able to use eBenefits effectively because his sock needs keep changing. He uses MyHealtheVet for his ongoing medical appointments and prescriptions.

### Frustrations <br>
- Being referred to the VA to be remeasured for adjustments to his sock orders
- The VA being difficult for him to get to, as he hasn't adapted his vehicle and he lives far away from the nearest hospital
- Being unable to order all of the items he needs at once unless he calls the agent line, which commonly takes 45 minutes or more
- Frequently needing to adjust his sock specifications to meet his changing needs
- Seeing many different socks in eBenefits and having difficulties telling them apart
- Recalling the items he has or wants during the phone ordering process
- Being unable to order his hearing aid accessories through eBenefits
- Hearing aids dying too quickly and malfunctioning

### Goals <br>
- Order all of his resupplies at once without the wait
- Get his hearing aids repaired or replaced
- Adjust his sock order without being referred to the VA clinic

### Scenarios <br>
- Jacob is running low on his regular hearing aid resupply order and needs to place the same order as last time.
- Jacob thinks his hearing aids are malfunctioning and wants to send them in for repair or replacement, but he doesn't sure how to.
- While still healing, Jacob's leg has shrunk and made his current socks too big at the toe. He wants to adjust his sock dimensions to get a better fit without going to the VA.

## Bruce<br>
Bruce is Veteran who had a partial limb amputation due complications from diabetes. He has been using a below-the-knee prosthetic limbs for the past 10 years and routinely orders his regular prosthetic socks through the VA once or twice a year. Bruce originally relied on his clinic to order his sock resupply since he is there often, but he overheard another Veteran talking about DLC and has been emailing his orders ever since. Bruce is not very comfortable with technology outside of typical email usage. He knows about the other ordering methods, but prefers to order via email as he's not much of a "phone person."

### Frustrations<br>
- Brands changing or discontinuing his favorite socks
- Having to search back 6+ months to find the email he duplicates to send a new sock request
- Having to go to many sites to deal with his routine tasks
- Having to sign into accounts and reset passwords when he forgets them

### Goals<br>
- Order online without having to log into anything
- Find out about discontinuing products and find alternatives

### Scenarios <br>
- A few pairs of Bruce's socks have worn out and he wants to order his usual selections.
- Bruce has lost weight and now needs to up the ply / thickness on his favorite socks.
- Bruce's favorite brand of wool sock has been discontinued and he needs to find an alternative.
- Bruce has been experiencing some irritation due to heat and wants to order sheaths to curb the discomfort.
