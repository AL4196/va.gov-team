NOD Similarities to HLR:

- [x] Veteran details
  - Veteran's Name (first, middle & last)
  - Veteran's SSN and VA file number
  - Veteran's date of birth
- [x] Veteran contact information (or person filling out form)
  - Mailing address (street, City, State, ZIP & Country)
  - Email address
  - Phone number
- [x] Issues
  - Choose specific issues
  - Issue date of decision (not on HLR, but we should already know that) since we're displaying the issues

New portions in NOD (not in HLR)

- [ ] I am not the veteran
  - Name (first, middle & last)
  - Date of birth
- [ ] I am homeless
  - Only a checkbox on the NOD
  - I think we should determine if it needs to be more involved like how form 526EZ's asks for more details. HLR doesn't deal with homelessness at all. In discussions with @kevinstachura, I think this (how form 526EZ handles it) should be a more standard part of every form.
- [ ] Board review options
  - 3 radio buttons (not checkboxes like the form)
  - Maybe include an additional info component to show more details about each path
- [ ] Opt in from SOC/SSOC
  - Similar but may not be exactly the same as the opt in planned for the HLR.
  - This checkbox seems to be a more global option; if the applicant checks this box, does the person doing input processing decide which legacy issues match and then opts out? Or should it be more granular like we have planned for HLR?
