## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)

- Lets spend a few minutes now, were I send you the prototype of the website we will look at today. 
- First, please minimize or close any windows that you don't want to share with us.
- Now I'm going to share a link to the prototype in the zoom chat. Can you find the chat button in the Zoom app? 
- Great, can you click on it? There should be a link you can click on there. 
- Can you navigate back to the Zoom window and click the "Share" button in Zoom? 

*We go through the process of screen sharing*

**Warm Up Questions**

Before we look at the prototype of the website, letâ€™s start with a few general questions.

C: Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of prompts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)

P: I live in [city], [state]. And I did do a veteran interview probably about a year, year and a half ago. I think it was with Shannon.


C: She was the recruiter, right?

P: Yeah yeah, she was.

C: How was that experience?

P: Oh good, good! I like giving my thoughts on things.

C: So you know how this goes.

C: Have you filed an disability claim with the VA?

P: Yes I have.

C: Did you do it online, fax, VSO?

P: First time in 2005, I think I just went to the office. Went to the DAV office and they helped me fill it out. I did a second one for another disability in 2011 and I did that online. 

C: When you went to the office, how was that experience?

P: It was good! it takes a while to get an appt, you're only in the office like 20 minutes but it takes all day.

C: How about the 2011 online process?

P: I did like doing it in the comfort of my own home, and could look at my paperwork and do it.



**1st screen: Intro HLR page**

C: Let's start to take a look at this prototype. So imagine now that a benefit that you have applied for (ringing in the ear, Tinnitus) has been denied. And you log into this website and you come into this website, and this page. Can you tell me what the main purpose of this page is and what you'd do on this page?

P: Maybe say, umm...IF your appeal is denied, you have another chance...you can request - this is your next step if your initial claim is denied. Maybe something like that. So someone doesn't just come in here and do the first one on this. They might think they can get a better outcome maybe. 

P: Yeah no this is good here. 

C: So what is good about it?

P: it's nice and clean and clear...not all mumbo jumbo, or blinking lights and ads and stuff. And then umm...oh yeah here ya go...a Veteran Services Officer, that's good. It's hard to get someone at the VA, it's hard to speak to someone.

C: So you're saying if you called the number?

P: Yeah, so when I've called in the past. I normally call my county services officer.

C: What other comments do you have about this page?

P: Let's see...No I think this is good. It's nice and clear, I like that.

C: So before you click on anything, what do you expect to see when you click on that button?

P: you know, name, address, dates of service that I put in prior. I'd hope that it would have my initial claim, for my disability and what I put in the first application so I didnt have to do it again.

C: So when you look at this page, is there anything that is unclear of confusing?

P: Umm....no....yeah no it's laid out really simple and nice.

C: So you can go ahead and move to the next step.

P: Click right here?

C: Yup!



**2nd screen: Opt out page**

C: And tell me what you think the purpose of this page is and what you can do on this page.

P: Oh, you gotta opt out....oh ok...oh yeah that makes sense! Yeah this is good, this makes sense.

C: So what do you think this actually means, if you've gone through this step?

P: That you kinda..(reads)...that it's going to kinda a whole different process, a different system. And that you think because it's through a higher level that it might be faster or better.

C: Is is that something you read, or is that something you are hoping for?

P: Yeah I'm kinda hoping for. Yeah this is clear.

C: Is there anythig on this page that is unclear or confusing? Or is there any info you'd like to add to this page or any info that you'd like to have answered that you're not seeing here?

P: So you dont have to worry about starting from square one again. That you don't have to redo everything that you sent in.

C: Got it. So what info would you need to see here that would make you feel comfortable that you wouldnt have to start over agian?

P: Maybe right here under (I'm removing my claim and hearing from the old process) you could say 'removing my claim under related hearing request under the old process and request it continue under the NEW appeals process' so it's just continuing on, but a different process.

C: So when you look at this page, do you interpet this page as meaning that you opt out for ALL the claims in the system or just the claims you will add to this system or flow as you go along?

P: I take it that it's just for this claim only than just my previous ones.

C: Is that clear for you or not so clear?

P: You could add that this withdraws the claim for THIS one. So I'm not gonna mess with my old claims that are decided.

C: Got it. Good. Any other comments?

P: No, looks good.

C: Sorry if there is background noise outside. SO if you have no more comments on this page you can move on.


    
**3nd screen: Personal Info**    

C: Just take a look at this page and tell me what you see here?

P: Yeah no that's good, that it's my file...you have this info and my files, that's good.

C: Anything unclear or missing?

P: umm...you can say 'please double check' or 'continue if this information is correct'. Someone could've entered their birthday wrong or something.

C: If this was swrong, what might your options be?

P: I would call this number, the 800 number...and if I couldn't get through, I'd still continue, then maybe somewhere down the line I could say that my DOB is wrong or something.

C: So you can go ahead and continue to the next page.


**4th screen: Contact Info**    

C: Take a look at this page and tell me what you see here.

P: Oh yeah this is good. You can edit yourself. These things change more often. You don't have to call anyone or anything..

C: Why do you think you can edit this page and not the previous?

P: because that stuff, SSN, birthdate never changes, if it was incorrect, might've been typed in wrong. That stuff just doesn't change.

C: Exactly, exactly. Is there any info on this page that is missing or unclear?

P: No that's good! I like how its nice and clear. Not all crushed together, it's spaced out.

C: We can go to the next page.
    
**5th screen: Contested Issues**
    
C: So tell me what you think the main purpose of this page is and what you can do here.

P: These are the two claims the vet put in for. The first one they just got 10% and the second was 50%. And if they think the ringing in the ears is getting worse, or worse, it's beating, then you can click on that and then you can ask for an HLR on that.

C: Do you expect you could click on both>?

P: Yeah I definitely think you can. And I think if you think one rating is accurate, then you could just do one or both.

C: What issues do you think are listed on this page and which issues do you think are not listed on this page?

P: Umm...maybe if you have another disability request but it's already at 100%, you don't need to ask for that for an HLR, these are the only two eligible ones, and maybe you put in for 3 and the third one got lost maybe. You can see what the VA has on you.

C: Exactly. So if there are other issues you have, but for some reason you don't see them on this page, What would you do then?

P: I'd go here [dont see the issue]. Maybe it's still being decided, or....one was rejected or one was already rated at 100% or something.

C: What would you expect to see if you click on that?

P: That you could call the VA to see why one isn't listed and what you should do. And for some reason it never went through and it got lost.

C: You can go ahead and click on that and tell me if that's what you expected to see.

P: Oh ok. Oh ok! That's good to know about the one year. Ok...that makes sense, that might be for insurance or something. i like that you can fill out one if you need to fill out for something other than compensation. No that's good. That kinda explains everything.

C: So when you say it's good, what do you think is particularly helpful?

P: That there is a timeline, that there's only a year to appeal or ask for an HLR, and then um..someone might be confused that the decision as for another benefit not just a disability. Health insurance. And then umm...if it's not in our system...so if it's not in the system, then the decision letter tells you if you're missing a form or - if you're missing a medical form or some evaluation. Youy could put it here. 

C: You could put it there - are you talking about the decision letter, or...?

P: Yeah, it doesn't make sense to go to the letter when you're already on the website. Maybe to double check records.

C: You see there's a button that says 'see all issues'. what do you expect to see if you click on that?

P: All of the disabilities claims I've put in. I put one in in 2005, and I would click on that and see that I've already put that claim in and received that benefit for 2005. I think it's called ebenefits? Maybe a link to ebenefits so you could see your stuff on claims. A lot of people, seems like they don't know about ebenefits. There's a lot of stuff there. To see more detailed info on your issues, go to ebenefits.

C: Ok, so show me what you'd do to move to the next page.

**6th screen: Notes**

C: Take a look at this page and tell me what you'd do on this page.

P: Yeah I would umm...I think contested issues - maybe say contested disability rating. Because you're contesting the rating. Not so much the issue but the rating itself. Bcecause you want a higher rating. Then why do you think the rating should be increased or changed? They do take awhile, so you might've had a hearing test while this rating was being decided, so maybe you could add more medical information that I had. Or if I forgot...or on the day I filled out the form my Tinnitus wasn't bad but it's worse than it was, or something like that.

C: So when you look at this page, what sort of info do you think is relevant to put in here or not?

P: You could say 'have you had a recent medical test that could increase your rating, or...has your disability gotten worse, and how'? What reason do you think - you know, why do you think you should have an increase in your benefits?

C: So do you think this page is where you can add upload new or relevant medical evidence or not?

P: Right here it says 'new and relevant evidence' I feel like I click on that, I can upload new stuff, or at least an address where I can send stuff to. Some vets get letters from their buddies to back up their claim. I've served with this person and I noticed in the end, he was complaining about ringing in his ears. If you want to upload a letter or something.

C: You would expect you could upload new evidence if you click on that link?

P: Yes.

C: What if I told you that in the HLR, you can't upload new evidence. What would you say to that and how would you use this page now that you know that?

P: Oh, ok. Umm...well I'd click on this link and see and explain why...you can't add more to this claim, its just a review basically, and if I do have more evidence, if it would be better to start a new claim or not.

C: Any other comments?

P: No, that's good.

**7th screen: Same Office**

C: Tell me a little about this page and what you think this means.

P: If you'd like the same office that gave you the first decision to conduct the HLR. I wouldn't want that, you'd want some fresh eyes...and you'd wonder about office dynamics. If the guy next to you is doing an HLR and now they are granting the claim when you initially denied the claim, you know how office stuff is.,..I'd want a different office. If the office did the prior decision, I wouldn't want them to do it again! I might end up with the same guy. 

C: So in this case, you'd choose no?

P: Yes.

C: Ok so you can click no and tell me how you interpret that.

P: Oh ok. I suppose maybe they have some specialty people. Maybe just focus on medical health issues.

C: Does this make it clearer what the purpose is?

P: Yeah, that it might not be possible. They'll try. That's fair, if they can't they can't. but as long as they try.

C: What do you think about this information popping up after you click no?

P: Yeah, I would maybe say...I would put something up earlier. Because it's like you're asking yes or no, then you say no, then you say you MIGHT be able to. Or something like normally we send your HLR request to the same office, however its' possible we could sent it to a different office. 

C: Got it. We can move to the next page.


**8th screen: Informal Conference**

C: So tell em what you see here and purpose of this page.

P: If the reviewer, if you're in the same area...OH! I see it's call...like a conference call. Maybe in the first paragraph you might put that it's a conference CALL. Because I thought I might have to drive there. Oh that's good, yeah.

C: You can choose 'yes, call me'. Take a look at this.

P: I'd just say monday-friday. No that's good.

C: So imagine for this test, you'll click on 12:30, before you click on continue, you can take a look at that.

P: No that's good, that's fair enough.

C: what do you think that means, what would it mean to click continue?

P: Just scheduling a time to have your phone on, and nearby, and be aware that its not a telemarketer or a scam caller. That you answer the phone. And that the VA might be calling. They'll call twice within the same time period. And that's fair, if you don't answer your phone or something happens, they'll still proceed. 

C: So when they call, do you think the call you're receiving, do you think this call is for the informal conference or if this is to -

P: ohhhhh, I understood that it's just to schedule. To SCHEDULE the conference. So it's easier. So this call is just to set up the conference. Because the conference call might go 20 minutes or half hour.

C: What do you think about the system - choosing a time or two times?

P: I like that - because I know when to answer the phone or maybe I have it off. But I'll set a little alarm on my phone just to be aware that someone's gonna call me.

C: When would you expect them to call? One day after, a week after, or what?

P: I would hope in the same day, but if not, you could say that in the instructions. We'll try you once, then we'll try the next day.

C: So from looking at this page, that it'd be same day, or...?

P: I figured it'd be twice in the same day.

C: what day would it be?

P: Oh see I wouldn't know that.

C: And what do you think about that?

P: Well...they're busy so they can't make phone calls all day. Maybe we can choose a specific date or specific week. 

C: Good, so let's move on.


**9th screen: Review**

C: Take a look at this page and what you see here and what you do on this page.

P: I'd check the plus marks and I'd review everything, and then um...make sure everything's ok...

C: Take a look at the info and let me know what's missing here and what is confusing or unclear.

P: yeah...that's the one I clicked htere. And I could add another at the last minute, like the headache one...yeah this is good. And then it reminds me of [what I chose].

C: Anything here that is unclear or confusing?

P: I'd say that if you could print out, some people like to print it out.

C: So you'd like a print out button?

P: Yeah! So when you get to your call with the reviewer, at least you can remember what you said.

C: So you wanted to have them specify a day or week they could contact you?

P: Yeah.


**10th screen: submit**

C: Take a look at this page and tell me if anything is missing here or if anything is unclear.

P: Ok...(thinks)...you could maybe say 'the review may take up to 90 days'. Because everyone gets real antsy and wants a specific time frame. But maybe just say 120 days.

C: Anything else you'd like to add to this page?

P: No this is good here. Oh yeah, then you can track the status.

C: What would you expect to see if you could click that?

P: So like, the ebenefits one, so the steps...like, the office has received your claim, or the office is in the process of deciding your claim.

C: So this is the last page of the proto, so I'd like to ask you a couple questions about the overall experience.

**Final Questions**

C: What do you think of this process overall?

P: Oh I like it! It's clear, nice and clean, not cluttered. It's real simple to use. It's not all squished together. Even the double space - it's easy to read. There are phone numbers to call if you have questions or anything. Really easy. Real simple.

C: What was most confusing?

P: Umm... I wasn't really confused, I mean, I had a couple questions, but it wasn't really confusing at all. Not for me anyway. Veterans now, with all the Iraqi and Afghanistan guys, they're young guys. They're real tech-savvy. Not like the Korean or WWII vets that aren't so good at computers. I'm sure they can figure things out.

C: What do you think was most helpful?

P: I liked that there are 4 steps and it was 1,2, 3, 4. So it doesn't go on forever, and that it's divided into 4 steps. And you can come back to it if you only get to step 3.

C: that was the last question! THank you so much for taking the time and doing this interview.

**Christian goes though cliosing**
