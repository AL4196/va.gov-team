# Notes for Participant 5 - Higher Level Review

## Intro - 5 minutes

C: Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the appeals process on VA.gov, specifically an appeals process that we call a Higher Level Review. 

**Christian goes through setup items - removed for brevity's sake**


## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)

- Lets spend a few minutes now, were I send you the prototype of the website we will look at today. 
- First, please minimize or close any windows that you don't want to share with us.
- Now I'm going to share a link to the prototype in the zoom chat. Can you find the chat button in the Zoom app? 
- Great, can you click on it? There should be a link you can click on there. 
- Can you navigate back to the Zoom window and click the "Share" button in Zoom? 

*We go through the process of screen sharing*

**Warm Up Questions**

Before we look at the prototype of the website, letâ€™s start with a few general questions.

C: Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of prompts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)


C: Have you filed an disability cliam with the VA?




C: how did you file it?



C: How was that process?

 

C: Have you ever filed an appeal?



C: how did you file it?



C: How was that process?



**1st screen: Intro HLR page**

C: What is the purpose of this page and what you would do here?

P: Request a Higher Level Review so it's right up front. And it looks like it's going to guide me through the request for preparing a Higher Level Review. There's the steps, then I can click the button for starting a Higher Level Review so thats what I'd do I guess.

C: So before you click on that: What do you think it would do if you clicked on it?

P: If I click on this, I'm not sure I would miss the steps. The button maybe should be below the steps instead of above the steps. I mean it is, but maybe it shouldn't be up here as well.

C: Is there anything here that is confusing or unclear?

P: Nah, it's pretty straightforward. The key is that you're setting the expectation that you should be able to get the review completed in 125 days.

C: What would you expect to see if you click on the start the Higher Level Review button?

P: A screen that would have me start filling in information. I would expect to see something more along the lines of a Turbotax screen where I put in the information and then end result would be a finished application.



**2nd screen: Opt out page**

C: Just take a look at this page and tell me what you see and what you think the purpose is.

P: It's not the page I thought I would get so...

C: Yeah, take a minute and look at it.

P: it's kinda like a curveball....because you're asking me to opt out of the old system and I think that's something you should've asked me before I started the form.

C: Is it clear what will happen if you hit continue on this page?

P: y'know, I think what's missing here, is, why should I do this if I did happen to have an old appeal? theres no benefit explanation. Alls it's asking is if I want to opt out of the old system.

C: Where would you expect to see that info?

P: well all this should be before I start filling in an appeals, Higher Level Review request,

C: So what would make you comfortable to opt out and continue?

P: Well I think there should be some listing as to why I should do this. Umm, you know, is it going to accelerate the time that I will get a decision on a review? I just don't umm...there really is no explanation of why I should go to the new system here.

C: Any other questions you have about this page or concerns?

P: No, that's the big one.

C: So now you can show me what you would do to move this along.

P: I'd click the box and hit continue.

C: You can do that.


    
**3nd screen: Personal Info**    

P: Ok, this is what I was expecting to see the first time I moved forward. This is just to verify your information.

C: is there anything confusing or unclear?

P: Well I guess I would expect the info to be accurate, but I'd be surprised if it wasn't accurate then you'd have to make a phone call since it's on the computer.

C: What would you expect instead of that?

P: I'd hope for, if it was inaccuare, then you'd have a button to click to rectify the discrepancy instead of having to wait Mon-Fri, 8-5.

C: Go ahead and click on the 'next' button.

**4th screen: Contact Info**    

C: What do you see here?

P: Straightforward on phone number and mailing address. And here it lets me correct it by going to my profile page.

C: So if you were able to go the profile page, what would you expect to see and do there?

P: I would expect that if I wanted to change my primary phone number that I could do it there instead of having to go to my profile page and do anything. By doing the edit it would be able to do the update there.

C: What do you think about the edit button there?

P: I think it's imperative to have the right contact info.

C: Why do you think you can edit this and not the info on the previous page?

P: Problem wth SSN or VA number, making those changes could be commiting fraud so...getting off the computer and then interfacing verbally prolongs the process of submitting an appeal. 
    
**5th screen: Contested Issues**
    
C: Tell me about this page and what you would do here.

P: So I'm gonna make the assumption that these are the two conditions that have been disproved and ask for a change because of the current rating...whatever I click on, Tinnitus or headaches - would be the one I'm appealing.

C: What would you expect to see if you opened the 'don't see the issue you're looking for' link?

P: I'd have to believe it was all the other...everything I've ever submitted for. It would list all the condiitons I was at one time claiming.

C: You can go ahead and open that link and tell me, is that what you expected to see?

P: That's not what I was expecting. I was expecting to see the issues I wasn't expecting to see an explanation. Why wouldn't that explanation be on the previous slide, underneath where it showed eligible issues. Because I was expecting to see the issues.

C: When you look at the text is there anything confusing or unclear?

P: well...I guess if I'm 3 clicks into this form, and the issue about pension or other compensation issues, that should be explained well in advance of starting the form. So I think that needs to be introduced much earlier than this slide.

C: Can you expand on that?

P: Well if I wanted to do a submission on pension, id feel like I wasted time if I had to do another form.

C: See the button 'don't see all of your issues'? What would you expect to see if you were to click on that?

P: Well I'd expect to see all the issues! I guess everything within the last year I would expect to see populated.

C: Ok, good. lets now imagine that you're on this page and you are appealing for Tinnitus, so show me what you'd do.

P: I'd click on Tinnitus then click continue.

C: Go ahead and do that.

**6th screen: Notes**

C: whats the purpose of this page and what would you do here?

P: I guess this is my opportunity to justify why I believe an appeal is needed. And I see what if I had new and...a place where I would possibly insert new evidence to substantiate my appeal.

C: And then you see the button evidence down there..'what if I have new and relevant evidence'. Why do you think that's there?

P: Well I think in any appeal I'm gonna have more medical information to submit and I think this is my opportunity to do that. If I click this, it would be a traditional set of instructions on how to upload another file.

C: What if I told you this is not a page to add new evidence? So the text that you put into this form isn't for new evidence but more just to write about your case. In order to do that you'd have to click on this link. What do you think about that?

P: well then...the only...the whole purpose for submitting review is because you don't agree with the decision...I guess if you wanted the decision to be changed, you would provide relevant information. I'm kinda left..you almost HAVE to start including relevant information. Otherwise the only thing that says you got it wrong...here [refers to sentence] why you got it wrong and that 'why' is relevant information.

C: Would you use this page?

P: Well you're gonna discuss the relevant info, when you contest something...I would try to describe how the issue is impacting how I'm able to do my work, or how it affects my life,. But at some point I need to substantiate that, so...yeah.

C: You thought this would allow you to upload evidence?

P: Yes, I thought it would do that.

C: Do you think you would use this page?

P: I would use it but I would kinda feel...I kinda think if the intent is NOT to provide new and relevant information in this block then maybe there should be a further explanation of when I can do that.

**7th screen: Same Office**

C: Tell me what you think the purpose of this page is?

P: Would you like the same office to conduct the review? I'd say no (laughs)...that's an interesting choice I'm given. Not sure if it happens that way but...my initial assumption is that same office would not necessarily be adjudicating the appeal. so I would click 'no'.

C: So go ahead and click 'no'. And take a look and tell me how you understand that.

P: I guess maybe..I don't like what I'm reading because it's wishy washy...again, when I read the 'prior office to conduct a review'...an office consists of many different employees and obviously I wouldn't want to have happen is Joe Smith is the one who made the initial decision I wouldnt want Joe Smith adjudicating my decision for a Higher Level Review. But that's not what this says, so. I don't even know...I guess I understand there can only be one office that did it. I'm talking around myself now but I'm not sure the relevance of asking this question. Some thing like 'the folks who originally made the decisions for your initial decision won't be making the decision for your review.'


P: If you're asking me a question about what I want to do and then telling me that youre not gonna do it then I don't know why you'd be asking me in the first place.



**8th screen: Informal Conference**

C: What's the purpose of this page and what would you do here?

P: I, ok. Yes, I would click yes. I would just determine if this is best for me or my rep to do. But this is before I've given you any information?

C: You'd be logged in, yes.

P: I'm talking about the Higher Level Review before.

C: If you were going to this flow and never done it before, then yes. This would not have the additional evidence.

P: I just feel like I should be able to give information if it's warranted. Before I get an informal conference.

C: So let's say you have given the additional information and you want them to call you. Go ahead with this step. Let me know if anything is unclear or confusing.

P: No I think it's pretty straightforward, there was one question I had earlier about submitting a phone number, but maybe not the phone number to have this conversation.

C: So maybe youd want to change that?

P: Call my rep, I'd need to insert the number at that time. But I'd like to submit a number if you call me in case it's a home number or work number.

C: What if you click on the time and continue?

P Again, I think I'd have to submit some relevant info, but at some point, I'd like to think there'd be a submit button. At some point I'm gonna hit submit. So I'm getting close to that, I believe.

C: So what about this informal conference? What if you click 12:30? What do you think will happen with this informal conference that you are requesting?

P: I think an individual will call and speak to me. [speaks in hypothetical scenario] "Hi, I've read your request, is there any further info that you'd like to tell me that would give me greater insight into what you're asking for"?

C: So what is the purpose of that phone call?

P: Purpose is giving the veteran the opportunity to present their case.

C: Do you think the call is for the informal conference?

P: I think that's what it's gonna result in...[takes a minute to review text]...ah, I would use it for that as a veteran...I would make sure as a reviewer that there was anything to update the package. If there was an error or needed some substantiation.

C: When they call you, do you think thats the informal conference itself or a time to schedule the informal conference?

P: Oh my gosh I just read it and you're right! I thought it was for the conference itself and we would have it in that time block.

C: What do you think of this page and process?

P: Y'know I...realized something. There's no date here. There was no date...did I miss that? It wasn't on a specific date.

C: That's right.

P: so this isnt very good. So any day I can get a call between 12:30-2. That's ridiculous. You need to have a date so the individual isn't left hanging. The vet may want to have a call with a rep available. If it's to set up the call without a date then this is a pretty worthless evolution.

C: So you expect this page is to set up the actual informal confertence?

P: Yes.



**9th screen: Review**

C: What is on this page?

P: I guess I could review the application, so I guess I could click on the plus signs to review the information I put in.

C: Look through this page and tell me what you think about this page and what you'd do here and if anything is confusing or unclear?

P: I have no idea about the information under Tinnitus. [references placeholder text in latin]. No veteran is going to have that information!

C: Imagine this is a description in English for Tinnitus.

P: ok...so it would be everything that was input at that point in time. It says request an informal conference...that's misleading. It asks if you wanted to schedule an informal conference. That makes it seem like it's for the conference.

C: Any other comments about this apge?

P: No I think thats it.

C: So go to the next page.

**10th screen: submit**

C: This is the last page of proto. Just take a look at it and tell me what you think about it.

P: I submitted this...gonna get a letter. Boom. But after you request a decision review. That term hasn't been used before. That's a new term popped out. What happens next? What about the informal conference...I don't see that there. If you requested an informal conference, that would happen, and then after the Higher Level Review is complete, will get the information. Yeah, I just think you gotta...add that to this list.

C: Any other things that you think are missing on this page?

P: Again, very last sentence, if you request a decision review. Instead a 'Higher Level Review'. You gotta keep the same terms.

C: What do you expect to see if you clicked 'track status'?

P: It should say 'track status of your Higher Level Review' to stay consistent. Upfront you told the vet that you'd get a decision in 125 days, so the most important, initially, is that it's been recieved, but I suppose you get an email saying that. Or when it's being processed. I dunno what the necessary steps that the VA wants to tell the veteran.

C: Any other last comments about this page?

P: No.

**Final Questions**

C: What do you think overall of this process?

P: It looked like it was pretty simple to request one, overall. Everything was pretty straightforward, like to see that. Only thing is, and maybe not exactly intent, but maybe you could put documents next to where you substantiate a claim.

C: What is the most confusing part of this flow?

P: I think the whole idea of request a call to schedule an informal review. I think you should just request an informal review. I think that intermediate call confused me. As you mentioned to me, I went back and reread it and that's exactly what it said to do, but the VA is asking for a 2-hour block any day of the week but that's not going to work.

C: What do you think was most helpful?

P: I think the most helpful was, it was pretty straightforward. I think prepopulation fo conditions was pretty helpful. So as long as everything is in the system and pops up I think that's simple. 

C: What do you think would be helpful to users to add to these pages?

P: I think you should take out...that one, paragraph that if you wanted to submit a compensation or pension issue you've got the wrong form. That's gotta be shown before you start this application. 

C: Exactly, so move that up much further in the process?

P: Yes.

C: Other feedback?

P: It's really simplified, which is great!
