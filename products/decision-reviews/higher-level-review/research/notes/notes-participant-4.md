# Notes for Participant 4 - Higher Level Review

## Intro - 5 minutes

C: Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the appeals process on VA.gov, specifically an appeals process that we call a Higher Level Review. 

C: have you heard of that before?

P: I have, I'm going through one of those right now!

C: Great! I'm sure we'll get a lot of information from you then.

**Christian goes through setup items - removed for brevity's sake**


## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)

- Lets spend a few minutes now, were I send you the prototype of the website we will look at today. 
- First, please minimize or close any windows that you don't want to share with us.
- Now I'm going to share a link to the prototype in the zoom chat. Can you find the chat button in the Zoom app? 
- Great, can you click on it? There should be a link you can click on there. 
- Can you navigate back to the Zoom window and click the "Share" button in Zoom? 

*We go through the process of screen sharing*

**Warm Up Questions**

Before we look at the prototype of the website, letâ€™s start with a few general questions.

C: Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of prompts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)

P: Ok, umm...I live in [city], [state], was in the Air Force and have never done an interview like this before.


C: Have you filed a disability claim with the VA?

P: Yes, this is actually my third. I filed and everything was denied, and then filed again and then got a 50-60% rating, then again and got a higher rating and then this last time was for a Higher Level Review.

C: Ok, and how did you file it?

P: Last time I tried having a company do it for me. I tried doing it online, and my paperwork was lost when I submitted, and then part of the process...I think there are two different processes where you submit everything and then there's another where they do it for you...look at your records. They were unable to do that and they lost the paperwork and it took years just to get the first one completed.

C:Wow, that sounds frustrating.

P: Yeah, It was. I was having medical issues during that process. I think, that my ability to follow up and be aggressively calling back was [diminished]..so I ended up hiring a company to file on my behalf.

C: How was the process of using an external company?

P: It was SO much better. I did interview a couple companies and they were slow to respond but there are SO many companies out there that do that. Each company I went to, the cost for first filing was $1,000 and it went up from there. Not sure that's possible for everyone but for me...I didn't have the mental bandwidth to go through this.


C: Sorry you had to go through this. Now, let's take a look at the prototype.


**1st screen: Intro HLR page**

C: Tell me what actions you think you can do on this screen. And also, try to think out loud so I can follow what you're thinking.

P: I like that it looks clean. I'm glad it's clean and simple. To me, it alleviates some anxiety. It looks like it's going to be straightforward and not complicated. I like that it's laid out with numbers for me. And the time burden too. I know I can sit down and know I have 30 mins to - that it's not going to take longer than 30 minutes. I guess because of my past experinces of filing with VA, I approach it with the expectation that it's going to take a long time.

C: What do you think you can do on this page?

P: Begin my claim, or begin my application for HLR. So that's very clear. And again, this is a lot cleaner than the current page, and I dunno if that's your page too, but this is a lot better.

C: Is there anything unclear or confusing?

P: So right here [you'll need to opt out of old system] is that part of the process?

C: What do you think about that or what do you expect to see?

P: So...I guess it's something that's seamless that happens behind the scenes.

C: Do you think you know what that means?

P: I had to read it a couple times. I kinda hung out there for a minute to make sure it was correct...bceause it made it seem like I needed to do something. So that's why I thought I needed to do something. I guess actually clicking the application is giving the consent to withdraw.

C: So first you thought that you might need to do something to opt out, but you are now thinking that if you click the green button that it will opt you out?

P: Yeah, I think that's where I'm landing.


**2nd screen: Opt out page**

C: Tell me what you find on this paage.

P: Well this page definitely answers my question! It's very clear that I'm taking an action to opt out. Again, it's very clean, very simple, not overwhelming. I really like that.

C: So when you look at this page, is it clear what will happen here?

P: Yes, It is. And this is extremely clean and answers what questions I had on the other page.

C: this was kind of different than you expected, right?

P: Yeah, I was thinking that clicking on the green button would do that automatically. But this makes it clear.

C: Do you feel you were confident in moving past this screen here?

P: This page yes, but I would make one recommendation...It said when you opt out, that's it. You can't go back. I think maybe call that out in bold or a separate line, because some people may just come to this screen and just click and go and might not know what they're doing.

C: So making sure the permanency should be highlighted and easy to see.

P: I see a sentence down here, but maybe bold it. It's kind of like the apple [T&C's] where you just agree but not read it? Maybe just a reach-out so you know what it means.

C: Where might that go?

P: See where you have it say learn more here? Maybe you could make something here that tells you why it's beneficial to do this as opposed to the old appeals process? Bceause I know the site that I used - though I can't quite remember - but they gave two options for you to do the legwork to gather materials, and then the other process where you turned it over to VA so they could do the data collection for you. It was laid out there so I could make a decision and it made it easier.

C: So that choice should be more specifically spelled out?

P: I think so, yes.

C: Let's move on.

    
**3nd screen: Personal Info**    

C: Take a look at this page and tell me if this makes sense or not.

P: Yes, it makes sense. It's pretty clear. 

C: Do you have any questions or comments?

P: no, umm....I know for me, when I see a phone number, I think 'here we go again'....I know that's not your fault, but I know that's what they do to have you update information.

C: So you're saying the phone number is making you feel like 'oh here we go again...'?

P: Right, so having to call in, or having to do more things to fix the process.

C: What would you do if there was a mistake in the info here?

P: I would assume that I couldn't go any further. But I wouldn't want to go further since I wouldn't want it to be a nightmare moving forward if the info was wrong. If someone doesn't pick up the phone or if the phone call went poorly I would just give up.


**4th screen: Contact Info**    

C: Tell me what you see on this page.

P: It's great that you can edit it though! So was the intent that if the info was incorrect on the other page you could move forward?

C: Do you know why you couldn't edit the info on the last page?

P: Maybe it wouldn't be able to talk back to the VA and edit the info? Maybe because the last screen was permanent info like SSN or VA number you can't change it.

C: What do you think about the ability to edit here?

P: I think it's great! I feel comfortable editing it because it's on a secure site.

C: Anything on this page that is confusing or unclear?

P: Umm...well, this 'if you want to update acct info for your VA' I would wonder if I had to call the VA if this line was on the previous page or if you were able to update it on your profile page. If I could do it myself, I would feel more comfortable with that.

C: Do you expect that if you went to your profile page, that you could edit it?

P: I WOULD expect so, because it's a secure VA site, and they have that information, so I would assume I could go there and make those edits.
    
**5th screen: Contested Issues**
    
C: So tell me what you see on this page.

P: Ok, so I get to select the conditions. [hovers over 'don't see the issue you're looking for?'] Can I click on this?

C: You can try, sure.

P: Ok, so it's just pulling in...info as to why it wouldn't show here. So yeah, that's clear.

C: What do you think about the info you see here?

P: I like that it's here. I know veterans with multiple conditions. So the fact that it's there is nice. 

C: Is the text for the link similar to what you expected to be there?

P: No, it's kinda what I would expect to see there. And it answers the question, you know...I have Chron's disease and if I didn't see it here I would wonder why I didn't see it.

C: Anything that is unclear or missing?

P: no....no it could be just...unfortunately I'm familiar, naybe too familiar. So maybe those who have not been through the process they might have more questions but I don't think it could be much more clear.

C: So you see the button 'see all your rissues'...what would you expect to see if you click on that?

P: All of the issues I've filed a claim for.

C: So you can try to scroll up and imagine that in this scenario that this veteran has Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) so show me what you'd do here.

P: I'd click on Tinnitus here.

**6th screen: Notes**

C: tell me what you think you'd do here.

C: What do you think you'd see if you clicked the 'new and relevant evidence' link?

P: Probably like on the last page, but might give you more information on Tinnitus or whatever you might have. I don't think I'd change anything on this page. When I did it, I uploaded documents similar to this.

C: What kind of info do you think belongs in this box?

P: The severity of the issue, the frequency, if for some reason you think the reviewer missed some info or didn't consider some info in your package or if you had important information to submit.

C: Do you think you could add new evidence in this box?

P: You know, I would have, if I didn't see the link below that said 'new and relevant evidence', I would've thought I could.

C: So what do you think of that?

P: Maybe, umm...I like that the link is there, or maybe put that statement up, or maybe make it so that the user can see it first before they start filling in information.

C: Any other comments?

P: So where it says finish later, does it just save? And then I can just go back in?

C: Exactly, yes. What do you think about that?

P: I like it, but matybe you could put that in the first page. But if you had a cognitive disability that might make you take longer than 30 minutes, then it would be nice to know that I can come back to it.


**7th screen: Same Office**

C: Tell me what you see on this page and the purpose of this apge.

P: I know this was an option, and it's clear for me to understand. I feel like there's no way anyone could not understand this page.

C: Is it clear why you're given this option?

P: yes, the history. When you get a new set of eyes. I would definitely take the same office but there are some who would like to get a fresh pair of eyes on it.

C: click no and tell me what you think about this text.

P: Oh. Ok, no, I think that's great. But I dunno...maybe make it available before you click no? I think that would weigh into my thought process. That info would weight into my decision about staying in the same office or not.

C: So basically having this info before you click no?

P: Yes.

C: Anything unclear here?

P: no, it's definitely clear.

C: What is most helpful for you on this page?

P: I think umm probably the info on the box. Before I click no on this popup here, I would definitely start with the same office but it would be helpful to have all the information beforehand.

**8th screen: Informal Conference**

C: Tell me what you see here and the main purpose of this page is.

P: Oh so they give you an option to...(reads)..oh that's great! They give you the option, either you or your rep, to speak with your reviewer informally before they process your claim. 

C: Is anything here unclear?

P: No, it's very clear. I guess because everything I've done in the past - I've never appeared before a board. It's very clear. 

C: Imagine you wanted them to call you. What would you click on?

*clciks yes, call me**

P: Oh that's nice...gives you options to let them call you.

**clicks a time**

C: tell me if there's anything unclear here.

P: Yeah, it's very clear.

C: What do you think you're requesting here?

P: I was thinking that if I clicked yes and I could enter my phone number somewhere. Maybe even if it's in the system it's my landline and not my desired phone number. Or what if something happens on that day, on that time, and I can't make the conference but I still want to have a conference?

C: So what do you think would happen if you continued?

P: like, maybe a confirmation page? 

C: And what would be on that page?

P: Selection that they wanted to call me, specified date and time, and maybe that's where I entered my phone number or some type of invite?

C: So when they call you, do you think it's for the conference or to set up a time for it?

P: I'd think it was to call for the informal conference.

C: So you'd expect the call you get would be to actually do the conference?

P: Yes, that's would I would expect.

C: So this is actually to set up the call to SCHEDULE the conference.

P: Ah, yes, I see that here. I could've read that.

C: So how do you think this could be more clear?

P: I guess I'm wondering if I gave them a date and time I'm available, why couldn't they call me? Most of the time, that's most things. where I'm trying to schedule a time that's how it is. Even with a job interview, you pick a time and date and then call in! Why the extra step? That may be a VA policy thing.

C: You think it's a redundant step then?

P: Yes, but you're right that it says a time to set up a call to schedule the conference.

**9th screen: Review**

C: Take a look at this one and tell me what you think if anything is confusing or unclear.

P: It's clear, andf I like the opportunity to edit, and if you changed your mind, and instead made this yes instead of no, you could do that. I think its pretty clear.

C: So when you come to this page that's a review, would you prefer that the boxes are open or closed?

P: I work with some older vets, that might not know that plus sign opens up the box...maybe another indicator or just having it open up the screen?

C: Would you prefer them to be open yourself?

P: I would prefer them to be closed and then I could look at them one at a time.

C: other comments on this page?

P: No, just that you've built in places to edit.

C: What do you expect to see when you click on 'submit application'?

P: One of those 'thank you' pages maybe. I don't know why but I would like to get an email back or something that serves as confirmation that it all went through. or just something that lets you know that everything went through without errors.

C: So you would like to maybe get an email confirmation?

P: Yeah, something like that. Maybe even something I could add to my calendar.

C: You can go ahead and click submit.


**10th screen: submit**

C: Go ahead and take a look and tell me what you think.

P: It's clean and helpful and what I expect to see. Time frame to the next thing, and I know what to expect and when. What should I do while I wait...I think that's great too. Just to make sure there's nothing I have to do. 

C: Any information that's missing?

P: Maybe an email or info sent to email. I'd be interested to see what this buttons does [track status of you claim]. What does that show? Like tracking a package or something similar?

C: If you clicked on that, what would you expect or hope to see?

P: I would expect to see that the first stage was submitted, and the next stage was not done but the bubbles showing what was done, and what remains to do. Also a time frame for the next action...when do I need to start calling people if something doesn't happen within a certain date? I'd like to see next steps and time frames.

C: last page of prototype, and now just a couple general questions.

**Final Questions**

C: What do you think of this process as a whole?

P: It's easy. It's really easy. I don't have to upload a lot of info, only one box that says why I think my review should be considered. The one page where if our info is incorrect then you need to call someone, that was not great. This was a lot cleaner, a lot easier, I like the links that give me more info to get clarification on the language. It's so much easier than the process that we have, so much on the pages, so much on the margins....clicking around, clicking around, trying to determine where to be, find out what things mean. This is way better. I dunno what the final product will look like, but...this is clean. A lot better.

C: What was unclear?

P: I thought the scheduling of the informal conference was a bit confusing.

C: Ok, well thank you for your time! Your feedback has been helpful.
