# Notes for Participant 1 - Higher Level Review


## Intro - 5 minutes

C: Thanks for joining us today!

P: It's my pleasure!

C: My name is Christian and I also have some colleagues on the line, just listening in. Just going to talk about the appeals process on va.gov. Specifically, an appeals process called a higher level review. First, I'm going to start with talking about some practical things.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention: (Christian goes through these items)

- **This entire session should take about 55 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. In reality, we're testing our online services, in order to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Both positive and negative feedback is very welcome. 

- **During part of our session today, you'll be interacting with a prototype of a website.** The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. But, dont worry, I will guide you along. 
Of course none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

P: I do have a question and this is my first survey so I apologize but I'm new here. I am looking at a white box saying (participants, share, etc)...is that what I'm supposed to be seeing?

C: No that's perfect! Do you see something below called 'chat'?

P: Yes.

C: So I will be using that to send you a link, hold on one moment...if you click on the chat icon now, do you see the link I sent you?

P: Yes I do....

*link issues occur - fixed as we went along*


- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

P: yes I am.

## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


*We go through the process of screen sharing*

**Warm-up Questions (Optional) - (5-10 minutes)**

C: Before we look at the prototype of the website, letâ€™s start with a few general questions. Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of prompts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)

P: My name is [name]. I live in [state] in a suburb of [city]. I live with my husband, my mother and my dogs. I worked as a mental health professional.

C: sounds like a lot to learn!

P: Well who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks! I went back to school to learn this, and to learn to sign, and learned how to sign. This is my very first survey with this...I have done other focus groups, some in person...but this is my first one for VA. So, sorry for being slow maybe...


C: Have you ever filed a disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?

P: I did file a disability, claim. Yes I did.
 
C: How did you file it (online, mail, fax, VSO)?

P: I actually went to the regional office for the VA in downtown [city]. And I'm not quite sure if the lady who helped me was a VSO or what her title was.

C: How did you feel about that process?

P: Uhm...you know it actually was not as bad as I was anticipating. It was better than I was anticipating. I had a very nice lady, very patient, took time to explain the process and what was supposed to happen.

C: Have you ever filed an appeal with the Department of Veteran Affairs?

P: No I have not.
 
C: So now let's take a look at the prototype.
   

**1st screen: 
Intro HLR page**

C: Ok great, now lets take a look at the prototype of the website.  Not all of the links work but that's ok, I will guide you through. take a look at this page and tell me what you think the main purpose of this page is, and what actions can you take on this page?

P1:  Can I scroll up and down?

C: Yes, you can scroll, and just familiarize yourself with the page.

P: Well it appears to be a way of appealing a decision...that's what this looks like. It looks like it explains a little bit - haven't read the whole thing - but explains the process of filing an appeal and maybe opting out of the old way of filing an appeal.

*(Provide user with the necessary context for a Higher Level Review appeals process).* 

C: Is there anything confusing or unclear?

P: Uhm, you know, I don't see anything confusing but I do have a suggestion. You see the green bar where it says start a higher level review application? I would put it at the bottom maybe. Not to force people but to suggest they read the instructions, and follow the directions. If given the opportunity to so do at the top, I think people will do that.

C: So basically, instead of having two buttons, maybe just have one on the bottom?

P: That's what I would say, yes.

C: Imagine that a benefit that you have applied for (ringing in the ears - also called Tinnitus) has been denied. How would you go about disputing this decision? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. Please remember to talk out loud, so I can understand what you are thinking, what you are experiencing, and what you are trying to accomplish. 

P1: I was just going to make a comment, if I can. When reading this it says 'when requesting a HLR, I won't be able to add new evidence.' In my mind I'm wondering, 'why would I file an appeal if I can't add new evidence'? It's like taking out a hammer and hitting my own thumb. I try it once, it hurts, I do it again and it hurts again...so I would want that to be part of my appeal. So, this might not be what you were looking for, but yes.

C: That is EXACTLY what we're looking for. 

P: So I probably would've stopped. Because I can't add more information. I would've stopped and not gone further. I probably would've just gone to the regional office or VSO. I would've stopped.

C: So you would've stopped and gone to a regional office?

P: I would've stopped and gone to a regional office. Wouldn't have even gone to a VSO because I believe it has to go the the regional office anyway so just to take out the middle man.

C: So imagine that this problem was solved and you got back to this page.

P: So now I would click on start the HLR app. I would probably go look and see if there was a space to maybe add something...I would click on it and request and see...*clicks button* 

**2nd screen: Opt Out**  

P: See I don't think I would do this. I don't think I would do this opt out. I would probably try to jump this page and continue because I don't think this would work for me...I wouldn't want to cut off my nose to spite my face if I can just go to a VSO or regional office to submit new evidence. So I would like to see this page AT THE END.

C: Is there anything that is confusing or unclear?

P: I don't think it's confusing and I do have to compliment you on making this clear by bolding this information. 

C: So what would you need to know here in order to feel comfortable in order to click on this?

P: See...sorry I'm not sure if it's this page, It's the unknown of not being sure I'm able to....I went to an audiologist, lets say, and I don't know that I can...I don't know if I'm comfortable signing this. In case there's any other information that would help with appeals.

C: You mentioned you'd like to skip this page. Do you think you could do that?

P: I'm not sure that it will allow me to continue. I think if I don't check the box I don't think it'll let me continue. Most websites if you hit continue then it means that you've done what you need to do on the page.

C: So here it is required. What do you think about that?

P:....I don't like that. I don't know that I'm comfortable with it. I would probably go back to the VERY first page and look to see if links on that first page would allow me to see the paperwork. If I could see the paperwork and I knew I had the ability to put down the reason I had an appeal is because I had this test that clearly shows 'blah blah'...that shows that I have this claim for ringing in the ears I could show that, but at this point, I can't do that. So if I click on this I choose to opt ouf of the old appeals process, I'm not sure if I can submit it or if these pages are uploading every time I hit continue or if it'll submit when I hit continue. And like I said, if this doesn't allow me to add additional evidence...I think that defeats the purpose.

C: So let's continue. What would you do next?

P: I would try to hit continue without checking the box. I think it's nice that it says that we can review the options.

C: What do you think if you clicked on the view all issues link?

P: I would hope it would show my issues and tell me what my ratings are so I could really quick go - boom boom boom - and see everything there. I think the 'learn more about review options' might be on the previous page! I would learn more about other review options on the first page.
    
**3rd screen: Personal Info**    

C: Tell me what you see on this page, and what you think you can do here.

P: Well now, see this is pretty silly! From the standpoint of...I'm stuck! If something is wrong here, I can't continue. Now I have to call somebody. What if it's Saturday? During the day I'm busy...I'm doing my housework and doing stuff. Now I'm stuck! I didn't accomplish anything because you got my name wrong.

C: What would you expect to see here?

P: I'd expect to see an edit button. but I almost think you could make this easier! From the standpoint of...and again, from the beginning...if this info is correct, then move forward. If it's incorrect, the system will have to do it for you. Let's just say there's a common typo...there are a lot of 'S' in my name. Now I need to call in and change my info. You ever try to call VA or champ VA? You are on the phone for HOURS. We don't have time for that. I'd rather spend the time driving downtown and talk to someone and get it done.

I do like where it says finish the application later! I think that's a great plus. That's a great link.

C: Great, thank you! Let's imagine the details are correct and move to the next step.

**4th screen: Contact Info**    


C: What do you see on this page?

P: I think that it's great you're verifying my phone and email...see this is interesting...here you have edit buttons but not on the other info screen? It should be all or none in my mind. I think this is practical. I like that you have a link to the profile page....on the profile page, are you able to make changes?

C: What would you expect?

P: I would hopefuilly be able to edit it.

C: Ok, let's move on to the next page.
    
**5th screen: Contested Issues**
    
C: Take a look at this page and tell me what you think the purpose of the page is. 
 
P: I like this page. I like this page that you have it separated. there are two issues out here. The ringing of the ears as well as the headaches. I like the options...I don't know I can click both of these in case I wanted to contest both...

C: Would you expect to be able to click both?

P: Yes.

C: What else do you like?

P: I like the 'finish later', it doesn't seem to be tedious or cumbersome, so I like that. I get the sense that my info won't be lost and I won't have to start over again.

C: What would you do if you had more issues but don't see them here?

P: I would stop. It would depend...let's say I went to an audiologist and I wanted to add to my appeal. have I seen another doctor or neurologist for my headache? I'd like to pick and choose the ones I would want to have reviewed.

C: So if you don't see an issue that I don't see on this page, do you have any options?

P: I would click on the link below with the hope it would show me those issues. It's dotted, but it also has an arrow going down. 

C: What does that mean to you?

P: I think it might just be part of the prototype. I would hope that if I clicked this arrow, that it would list all of my issues that are 100%.

C: go ahead and click on it.

P: Ok so now it says some things might not appear at all....so my initial thought is that this isn't an inclusive review. You can only use this if your decision was made less than a year ago...and now it's saying that you could've gotten a lower rating based on a decision...so I don't see this as inclusive. So I would probably go back to the old [appeals process].

C: What would you expect to see for see all issues?

P: I was expecting to see those issues here...I would expect to see all my issues that are rated at 100%.

*clicks tinnitus*

**6th screen: Notes**

P: 400 characters is not a lot of space. So I would probably be limited to saying that I went to see a specialist who specialized in tinnitus and they performed an XYZ test and it showed I have had it for this long...whatever whatever. I won't be able to fit that in 400 characters. Doctor's address, phone number, all that would not fit. So I do not have a lot of space. I'm not sure I'd be able to give all the info a revewier would need.

C: What info do you think is relevant to put in here?

P: Maybe the date I saw the doc, fax machine, email address, tests performed, and results. That would be important to put in here. I see the link here about new and relevant evidence. That's great, but I'm expecting that if I click that, it'll tell me that I need to use the old process or go into an office to do that.

C: Is that clear here (that you can't add new evidence)?

P: First it said you can't add new evidence, and now it says what IF I have new evidence? So this contradicts the first page.

C: Any other comments before we move on?

P: Nope!

**7th screen: Same Office**

C: What is the purpose of this page?

P: This is kind of interesting...never seen this before...would you like the same office that conducted your prior decision to make the review? How would I know? I think this is a wasted page! I don't see the benefit here! And how do I really know? And when you get your decision it doesn't say 'John Smith from Omaha, NE decided your case' so I don't see what it does.

C: What do you think is the need for this?

P: As a stretch, I would have to say maybe....no I cant even stretch that far. this is just a waste. I don't see a purpose here.

C: Click on the no and tell me how you understand that.

*clicks no*

P: Is this a atrue statement?

C: Should be! Yes, true statement. Why do you ask that question?

P: Uhm...I guess to be honest, that was a personal question! To be honest with you. And I think maybe that's the confusion...I told you at the beginning I was in front of a person that I thought was knowledgeable and knew the process. I'm just surprised about this. I was under the impression that this was um..that the info - yes, you might've seen the audiologist for your ears maybe, but the doc wrote up your report and that went in front of a board.

C: For time, want to move forward. Is the text here clear or unclear?

P: Again, It's clear. I understand what it's saying. It's adding more people to the mix...now you've got multiple entities, too many cooks in the kitchen (spoil the soup). That's the feeling I get from that. There's a lot more people involved in this.

*clicks button for inf conference*

**8th screen: Informal Conference**

C: Tell me what this page is about.

P: This page tells me that this defeats the purpose of the online process! I guess my initial feeling when we started that we can file an appeal online, but this isn't really online. Now we've got people calling us. Which is fine, which is fine...however...however what if I'm not available to talk? So you leave a number and now I have to sit on the phone 3 hours to call you back? No...no. If I have to spend 4 hours to get it done and ALL done, that's what I want to do. I don't want to call and be on the phone for umpteen hours. 

C: Is it clear that you don't have to do that?

P: yes! That's clear. But I would think this is to my benefit.

C: Imagine that you are saying yes, call me. I do need to set up this time.

P: I'd click the box to say call me. And have them call me. I didn't have an attorney when filing my claim. Now it says please choose up to two time periods. 

C: Choose the 12:30 option.

P: It says 'we'll make two attempts to contact you'. They tell me they're going to call me twice, leave a voicemail. I hope that I can leave a callback number because I will call back. I would hope that as long as I responded they would get back to me. 

C: Then you can continue.

**9th screen: Review Application**

C: So here...what you can do here is click on veteran details...what do you expect to see?

P: I would expect to see my name, and there's no name here! I would expect to see all that...

C: The page before, you saw the information was collapsed into the box..would you expect to see everything open when you come to the page, or if you would like the little boxes?

P: I like the boxes. All the info might be a little redundant.

C: Let me know if anything is unclear.

P: I like the boxes, options to edit is nice...underneath where it says tinnitus, on the left side it's in English, in the right it's in Spanish!

C: Sorry, this is a placeholder in Latin.

P: Oohhhh, ok.

P: So this is kind of a review of what we've just done...I would tell people to try this online because I know I have the control to submit or not submit the information. 

C: So you like that you have the option to submit or not submit?

P: Yes I like that.

**10th screen: Submit**

P: I think it's interesting that NOW we have a privacy notice...so this is kind of a receipt here. I'd like to see a receipt button. So far I've not seen a print button.

   
**Overall**


C: What do you think about this process?

P: It's not HORRIBLE, it's an option. It's definitely an option for a homebound person. Maybe a disabled vet who wasn't able to go to an office very easily. I also see this as a benefit for maybe a homeless vet who could go to a library and do this.

C: What was unclear?

P: At the beginning when it said you can't submit additional evidence. I think what it should say is that you cannot attach any documents. 

C: Last question...was there any info missing throughout the process? And what would help to add?

P: I don't necessarily think anything was missing, you don't want it to be too wordy or overwhelmed, so I can't say that anything is really missing.

C: Any other last comments?

P: It says track the status of claim or appeal...how can I do that without having received a number, or a receipt? How am I going to track this? You're not telling me how to do that...and how do I do that? I'd expect to see a claim number that says '12345', or something that says you can follow your claim by clicking this link, or...

C: If you clicked on the track status button, what would you expect to see?

P: Claim number, date, what the status was....is it pending review, does it need more information...I would expect to have some sort of interaction with the status. Where are we at. Or if there was a problem.

**Christian does 'thank you and closing' process**
