# Notes for Participant 2 - Higher Level Review


## Intro - 5 minutes


C: My name is christian and I also have some colleagues on the line, just listening in. Just going to talk about the appeals process on va.gov. Specifically, an appeals process called a higher level review. First, I'm going to start with talking about some practical things. have you heard of that before?

P: Yes.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention: (Christian goes through these items)

- **This entire session should take about 55 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. In reality, we're testing our online services, in order to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Both positive and negative feedback is very welcome. 

- **During part of our session today, you'll be interacting with a prototype of a website.** The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. But, dont worry, I will guide you along. 
Of course none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 


- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**



## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)
 

*We go through the process of screen sharing*

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - (5-10 minutes)

Before we look at the prototype of the website, letâ€™s start with a few general questions.

C: Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of prompts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)

P: I'm a retired Marine, 21 years, live in [state], certifying official for University of [state] and other extension campuses...I do have a disability rating, have done the disability process, and submitting an addendum, and I help vets by pointing them in the right direction, getting them started and give directions to them.

C: How did you file your disability claim?

P: First time was before I got out of the military which I HIGHLY recommend...because once you're out it's hard to link a disability to your service. 

C: How was that process?

P: I did the addendum with the state of [state]'s office...I'm not so sure...I believe I did the other one on base...I believe I was able to go on ebenefits to see the status and what was done but I didnt file myself.
 
C: That was through a VSO?

P: Yes.

C: Have you ever filed an appeal?

P: No not yet, no.


   

**1st screen: 
Intro HLR page**

C: Ok great, now lets take a look at the prototype of the website.  Not all of the links work but that's ok, I will guide you through.

C: what can you do on this page?

P: So this is about a HLR...this is very similar to applying for education benefits, so happy to see it's consistent that way...it would be kinda nice to put a button where you could show more information because it's a lot of data on the page...just reading through it real quick. I think it looks pretty clear.

C: Is there anything particularly helpful?

P: well, umm...with the VSOs...that can be very...misleading. So the problem with a lot of VSOs - it's pretty straightforward - but with VSOs a lot of vets don't know where to go or who to see as far as reviews go. I probably would not want to go to someone who runs a bar. So not the American Legion or VSW which are actually bars. So I'm not sure...accredited representative...by who? I recommend most of my vets go to the [state] VA office.

C: Imagine you have applied for a benefit for ringing in the ears and this has been denied. You're logged in this page. What would you do to dispute this decision?

P: The button on top is not as necessary...I think it should be on bottom so they read through and they might have itchy button/trigger fingers and may just click on it. So I would click on that to go to the next level.


**2nd screen: Opt out page**
 

C: So tell me what you see on this page and what you might do here.

P1: So now I'm seeing I can opt out of the legacy appeal. So it tells me that there's an old system, but I don't know much about the old system, but I know there are benefits and disadvantages of using the old system vs. old, but it's not telling me that or impacts. I'd like to know that. Veterans are not completely daft, but maybe you could out a box over here that says what are the impacts of opting out of something.

C: So coming into this page without info, what would you do on this page? If you clicked on the learn more about reviews, what would you expect to see?

P: What is the effect of doing the review? Learn more about the review options. Yeah, that makes sense. I guess that's what I'm looking for. I think that needs to be...I think you're baiting people into clicking things. I think people see a big fat continue button and move on...

C: Would you click continue?

P: I would take the time to figure out what's going on with it. 

C: Any other comments?

P: So if I have contested issues, and I click on that, would it take me to a page with my contest issues?

C: Is that what you'd expect to see?

P: Yeah, I would expect to see that. Those smaller buttons are specific, but I didn't see them right away.

C: Let's say you felt comfortable moving forward. Let's click on continue.

    
**3rd screen: Personal Info**    

C: Tell me what you see on this page, and what you think you can do here.


P: This doesn't have address, contact info...guessing that's gonna come later. 

C: Any other comments?

P: No that's it. I'd like to review my address, contact info, phone number on file, etc. I'm guessing that's on the next screen.

C: Go ahead and click continue.


**4th screen: Contact Info**    

C: What do you think about this page?

P: A lot of vets think since they update it in one spot, they think it updates everywhere. 

P: if there is a link to update the information in several systems, put that here. Maybe a dropdown they could have links to other places. Vets move around, semi-homeless or even homeless, having to update that info is a pain. Other than that pretty straightforward, move on.

C: Great, you can click continue.
    
**5th screen: Contested Issues**
    
C: Take a look at this page and tell me what you think the purpose of the page is. 

P: I think this is pretty straightforward...yeah looks like you just select the issue...so is this for just one benefit type...or would this be to settle a debt?

C: so what would you expect?

P: Well...maybe different systems but I wouldbn't be opposed to it being in one portal to have them go in the right direction...multiple portals might be misleading. If this process is for all VA decisions, depending on which one they click, it'll send them to the right applications, for example, housing. Say I was denied and I wanted to contest that..if it was in this same window that would be great. It would allow veterans to have a landing pad, or a start.

C: What would you expect to see if you hit the 'see all your issues'?

P: I'm guessing would that take me to everything else? Education, or...? Oh so all my disability ratings, my VA education benefits if applicable, home loan if applicable, those things...they're not eligible for the HLR. If that makes sense.

C: Let's say your contested issue is tinnitus

P: Got it, yep. What is the flash that occurs when I click on this stuff?

C: It's just the prototype.

P: oh, got it. I'm a tech geek myself.


**6th screen: Notes**

C: What do you think about this page?

P: There shouldn't be a character limit. Also there should be an option to upload documentation....being able to upload supporting docs, letter, etc..I can't stand these text boxes because you can't review what you've typed. I don't think there should be a character maximum on it, because some people may have a lot to say!

C: What kind of info do you think is relevant for this box?

P: I dunno if there's any way to come up with cues for relevant info that the vet might want to include...for example, I'm 80%. I have stomach issues, and they don't know what it is...it's in my VA medical records. They still don't know what's wrong with my stomach...so if I was to put a claim in on that, how would I put that? I had dysentery...but sometimes we just have to get through it. The VA says you don't have supporting documentation, but...so how would I best be able to describe that in this box? I'd have to write a letter. 

C: So do you think you can add new evidence to this page?

p: I'm trying to click on the link about relevant evidence.

C: Do you think you could add new and relevant evidence on this page?

P: yeah I think you could.

C: Great, so we can just move on.

**7th screen: Same Office**

C: What is the purpose of this page?

P: It's giving them the option to have the same office or different office do a review. It's like having a second opinion for a doctor...maybe to have a fresh or second pair of eyes on it...I don't know why you'd want the same office on it. It should be going to a higher level...not the same office! So vets will be scratching their head like what? Why would I want to send this to the same people who told me no!?


*clicks no*

P: I think it's total BS. If you want people to stop making fun of VA, gotta get rid of this stuff. This tells me you guys don't know the process, that if it's an HLR it has to go to another office. If it's a HLR, it should be going elsewhere. This would just be a review of the people who have already reviewed it.

C: So do you think this is unnecessary?

P: As a vet, this tells me that you have a problem, that an HLR should never go to the same office. I think it's not necessary. But then if this does come out, then you're hiding stuff. As the VA. If it goes to a HIGHER level, it should not be in the same office.

*clicks button for inf conference*

**8th screen: Informal Conference**

C: Tell me what this page is about.

P: I think you should have an option to call me AND my representative maybe? Or just like we're doing right now, call me AND my rep. 

C: What's the benefit of that?

P: Then I know what's going on, the rep isn't speaking out the side of his neck about my stuff. I don't really know the guy at the State of [state] VA office.

C: So on this page, what exactly do you do?

P: You're just opting in or out to do an informal conference. if you opt out, they're gonna make a decision, if you opt in, you can have a conference with that reviewer to discuss the decision, you can give your input into the process.

C: Let's imagine you wanted them to call you. Take a look at that text and tell me if that's clear or anything is confusing.

P: I don't know what date it is. If the website is able to read my time, I would want that...sometimes they're able to read the time [zone] here, and some people don't like that, but maybe based on location would be nice.

C: Do you think this is for the informal conference itself?

P:...Ohhhh I see! It's to schedule the informal conference, I thought it was to do the informal conference! Maybe a fatter header that gives some type of language to say 'this is to SCHEDULE the conference'. Maybe a big fat header right next to call me that says 'to SCHEDULE the informal conference'.

C: Anything else?

P: I'm guessing if them calling you, that it's same day?? Or the next few days? I've got meetings all day for today so I wouldn't have time. 

C: Does it seem same day or other days moving forward?

P: This seems same day to me.

*User chooses 12:30 option*

P: No no, that looks good. If they screen calls and don't answer, that's on them. I deal with that myself all the time.

**9th screen: Review Application**

C: So here...what you can do here is click on veteran details...what do you expect to see?

P: No this looks good, just a review of everything you've put in so far.

C: Normally, the boxes are collapsed. Is that how you'd like to see it?

P: I'd have them all open. Whenever I do these types of things, I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, so I'd like to be able to see everything.

**10th screen: Submit**

C: What do you think of this page?

P: Everything's pretty clear...the VA needs to have an option, I know y'all love mail, but they need to have aan option to go paperless. Would be great to just have something sent to my email. I like track the status of claim or appeal that's good.

C: Anything missing?

P: Not that I can think of. Everything looks good. Unless you wanted to do another one. There was a headache one...can you do them together or separate?

C: What would you think?

P: If they were medical, I would hope you can do together. But if they were something different, like educational, you might have to do them separate.

**Overall Comments**

C: What did you think overall about the process?

P: I think I already told ya what was bad about which office was reviewing...but other than that...this process I think for a lot of people is daunting, so I think this will be beneficial, and they may not be as intimidated by it.

C: What do you think was most confusing?

P: Again, that section that talks about which office is gonna review it. Biggest point of contention process/procedure-wise about this.

C: What was helpful?

P: I like that everything is step by step. No long, giant disclaimers. I think this is the KISS method: keep it simple. I think this does that very well.

C: Do you think there is something that could be added to make this process easier?

P: Just to be able to make sure on the landing page, that you're able to review - down here you have track status of claim or appeal - being able to track the status is definitely important.

C: What would you expect to see to click on that track status button?

P: Dates/times and what steps it's gone through.

C: Any other comments?

P: Being able to use this same type of system for other HLRs, whether it be a debt, education benefits, home loan denial, etc..basically anything they could deny a claim, there should be a HLR process you coudl do for it. Maybe like a one stop shop to contest things.

C: that was all the questions I had. Thank you so much for taking the time to look at this - this was helpful to us!
