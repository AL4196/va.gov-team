# Notes for Participant 6 - Higher Level Review

## Intro - 5 minutes

C: Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the appeals process on VA.gov, specifically an appeals process that we call a Higher Level Review.

- Now I'm going to share a link to the prototype in the zoom chat. Can you find the chat button in the Zoom app? 
- Great, can you click on it? There should be a link you can click on there. 
- Can you navigate back to the Zoom window and click the "Share" button in Zoom? 

*We go through the process of screen sharing*

**Warm Up Questions**

Before we look at the prototype of the website, letâ€™s start with a few general questions.

C: Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of prompts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)

P: I live in [city], [state]. I served in the US Army, [method of service] in max security area in South Korea. Have I done one of these before? I have not.


C: Have you filed an disability cliam with the VA?

C: How did you file?

P: Initially I filled it out myself. And submitted it. 3 weeks later I got a letter that kicked me out. I talked to a VSO about it, and then she filed an appeal. Actually I have [disability] which I guess is tied to Agent Orange. [disability] from heavy gunfire. They did grant me a 10% disability rating for [disability] but they denied me for [other disability].

C: what did you think of the process?

P: It's a long, drawn out process, I'm a quartermaster for the VFW, and I volunteer for the DAV to drive vets to their appts and stuff. I have a lot of stores where people apply to benefits or items tied to their service and it seems like a long drawn out process and I believe it's designed for people to get fed up and quit. I just recommended to a guy, he's been turned down 3 times, and I hooked him up with a VSO. He's definitely eligible, definitely service connected. Tried to do it on his own but that was going nowhere. The doctors I saw in [city] said I had to get into the system. [participant tells personal story about his health details and service detail]


**1st screen: Intro HLR page**

C: What do you think the main purpose of this page is?

P: Looking it over, it looks like you can fill out an app for a Higher Level Review. There are instructions for how to fill out, and how to apply. Was just going to continue about what's on here, but you dont need that do ya?

C: Sure, anything confusing?

P: Well yeah, the goal for completing a review is 125 days. Is that reasonable or does that really take longer...It says that so people will be expecting an outcome in 125 days.

C: Mhmm. You can go ahead and continue with this flow. Imagine that a veteran is coming to this page with a benefit they've applied for, in this case Tinnitus, but it's been denied. How would you go about disputing this decision? Try and talk out loud as you progress.

P: Green bar has the start the HLR app so I assume I would click on that. This page is telling me I can opt out of the old appeals system. Just reading it though.


**2nd screen: Opt out page**

C: Take your time.

P: Would there be a benefit to opt out of the old appeals process?

C: What would you expect when you see this page?

P: What would be the benefit of opting out of the old system? That would be my question.

C: How would you find out more information about that?

P: Uh, well, there's a link to learn more about that and a link to look at contested issues...so I uh, don't know where I would see that unless maybe I called the 800 number.

C: So what would you do here?

P: I would probably just continue.

C: What would you expect to happen? would you opt out because you clicked the button?

P: I think there's not a lot of information about whether or not it's better to go through the new process.

C: Where would you expect to see that info?

P: Either one would be fine, it may be difficult to go somewhere and come back, but even if you had a short explanation, basically it would be to your benefit or disadvantage...to me, that's like...which way should I go? If it was more information right on this page, that would be better. If it were a link that would be ok too, but I'd prefer to have it right on the page.

C: So what would make you comfortable to click and continue?

P: To have that info in front of me, that would make me comfortable. If you wanna go forward right now, you could go forward. 

C: When you were coming to the opt out, and you didn't have the info to be comfortable making that choice, what would you do?

P: If there was an 800 number, I would call it and ask what are my options here? Does it benefit me to opt out?

C: Ok great, let's move on.
    
**3nd screen: Personal Info**    

C: What is the purpose of this page?

P: It has my information, and if I need to update this info to call this number. I guess this is to verify your information.

C: Is anything here confusing or unclear?

P: Not at all.

C: Anything particulary helpful?

P: Well you can verify your info. That would be beneficial. To see that the right info is on file.

**4th screen: Contact Info**    

C: What do you see on this page and purpose of the page?

P: Again, verifying contact information. Ability to edit this info. Again, pretty simple and I like that you can edit the information.

C: You can't edit on the other page, but you can edit this. Does that makes sense?

P: Well that's what's on file at the VA. I would expect that it's because they don't want you moving that information around, and that you would have to call to change any of that information.

C: Do you see the link about going to the profile page? What do you expect to see there and do you expect to be able to edit profile info?

P: I would expect it would have all your personal information - phone number, address, info about your service. Again, I don't think that should be able to be edited because that's info on your file, and you wouldn't be able to edit it without some verification.
    
**5th screen: Contested Issues**
    
C: What do you see on this page?

P: These are your issues that are eligible on file. Things you have applied for or received compensation for. Here it's Tinnitus or headaches. If you had others they would be listed. I see that there is a 'list all issues' here so I assume you could click on that and see more.

C: What would you expect to see if you clicked that?

P: I would expect to see a list of all your issues.

C: Click on it and let's see if you think this is what you expected.

P: See there's info here but also a button to see all of your issues. It tells you that it has to be a year, [more text]. The 'see all your issues' would probably show what you have for a claim, maybe things that were denied.

C: Let's say this vet has Tinnitus. What would you do?

P: I would click on Tinnitnus. If it were me I'd also click on headaches.

C: Do you think you should be able to click on both of those?

P: Yes, I would think so.


**6th screen: Notes**

C: Take a look at this page and tell me the purpose.

P: Well it's giving you the opportunity to add to your claim or information. Not exactly sure what you'd add to that. But if you had further information or testing, you could add to that. Only problem I see is 400 characters maximum. May not be for each individual's situation.

C: What is relevant to put in here?

P: I would think, other exams, family doctor, private doctor, or individual who does testing, maybe could determine hearing loss or Tinnitus lvel you're experiencing. You could list those dates and individuals that did testing you could list that. Whether or not that would be accepted I dunno. If you had other info, how would that be uploaded? For example, a result from an exam, you could scan that in as part of your claim. I don't see anything here like that where I could do that, but could be added.

C: what if I have new or relevant evidence? Why do you think the sentence below is there?

P: Well, what I was just talking about. That could be info there where you could fax or upload something here as an attachment. Kinda does away with what I was talking about up there, maybe a place where you could upload or send. 

C: What if I were to tell you that this page was really not for new evidence?

P: I would think that if that's the case, it should be worded differently. It says add whatever you want the review to CONSIDER. My assumption was that they were looking for more evidence. In my case, I could say I have constant ringing, bilaterally, but more in the left ear than right. Something I could put in there that I could prove that is the case. Now that I see that it's a little bit clearer that it's not new evidence.

C: Would you use this?

P: Yea I thihnk I would.

C: Ok, let's move on.


**7th screen: Same Office**

C: Tell me what you think this page is about.

P: [reads]....yes is checked, so I assume that's your first option. Again, um...what do they mean by 'same office'?

C: How do you interpret that?

P: um..from what I've read, and seen...articles I've read...of course on the internet you dont know what's true...but read articles that those who are reviewing are not totally qualified to do so. Maybe that they've not been in the service but are just rubber stamping and denying or approving. Now not sure that's the case but wouldn't want the same office doing it maybe.

C: So you might choose no here?

P: My first instinct, yes. Would be to choose no. So someone else was looking at it.

C: Click no, and tell me how this changes your understanding.

P: well....tells me that it doesn't matter what I think, they're gonna do what they're gonna do. Yeah it says they're gonna try but you have no idea if this is going to happen or not. You ask me my thoughts on this...why would you ask if you're not gonna do it anyway? (laughs)

C: Is this information clear?

P: Yeah it's clear.

C: Would it be better maybe if it showed before clicking no?

P: I would probably click yes, then continue. because it doesn't really matter if they're gonna do what they're gonna do. 

C: You think it doesn't matter if you click no or yes?

P: Well that's my opinion, yes.

C: Any other thoughts on why you'd want to have another office review this?

P: No, not really. I think we kinda covered that.

**8th screen: Informal Conference**

C: Tell me about this page and what you can do here.

P: This apparently is new...never heard of this before..informal conference. I think it's a good idea, depending on a person's situation, whether or not they want to be called depending ou their own situation. I think it's pretty easy to understand.

C: So the option you might choose would be 'yes call me'?

P: yes. Mhmm.

C: Click on that button.

P: Ok.

C: So tell me what would happen if you continued on this page.

P: I'm assuming they're gonna call you to schedule a time? Or will it be a call to schedule it?

C: What do you think about that?

P: Well it says pleaase select a time where you can SCHEDULE a call, so I'm guessing it's just a time to be available to then schedule it.

C: Yes, so you can choose the 12:30-2 time period.

P: Ok.

C: Is that clear?

P: Yes, that's pretty clear.

**9th screen: Review**

C: What would you do here?

P: This is a review so I would click on the details and verify the info is correct.

C: Now that you've clicked on the plus sign, we have it so all boxes open, but in the real website you'd click on each box to open. Would you prefer for each box to be open when you come here or closed?

P: I think the box concept is better because that way you can open each one. Then you can have that info in front of you and you can scroll. you can open or close each one and then go to the next box.

C: Tell me if you think anything here is confusing or missing.

P: No I think it's pretty concise, the info is all there. Now on the regular website I could close this and move onto the next box perhaps?

C: Yes, exactly.

P: I'm guessing I would click the privacy policy box and continue?

C: yes, go ahead and do that if you have no more comments.

**10th screen: submit**

C: What do you see here?

P: This is a notification that it's been submitted, and that they will be confirming your request in 5 business days...and when it's been submitted. And...what should I do while I wait? Nothing...they're telling you that they're gonna be notifying you. You can also track the claim and appeals to see where you're at.

C: If you were to click that what would you expect to see?

P: that it's filed and where it's at. some idea whether or not it's going anywhere or whether it's gonna sit. that would be my assumption.

C: Any other info to add to this page?

P: No, i think it's pretty concise, so it lists status of your claim down there so you could find out more info. Some people might be eager to click on it, so maybe you could say 'wait x number of days before checking your claim' or something like that. Might be helpful.

C: Any other comments?

P: No, not at all.

**Final Questions**

C: What do you think of the process overall?

P: personally I like it. I think its a good idea. Implementation of this, no idea when it would be implemented, but I would use it myself, and would recommend it to someone else to request a Higher Level Review - this is where you'd go to get it.

C: When you say you like it, what do you like about it?

P: It's very simple. It's not convoluted. It's concise. Each page gives you clear choices that you can make to move on. I think that's very helpful. There are many people who are not computer-savvy. They get confused whetn they do something like this, and I think this takes a lot of that away.

C: What information was particularly helpful for you?

P: It was a very smooth process? Each page was clear and concise. It gave you the opportunity to make a choice, and when making the choice, can move smoothly to the next page.

C: What was most confusing or unclear?

P: Some of the things we talked about were like....what are my options? Like, same person reviewing it. Until you click yes or no, you don't get any more info. As far as opting out of old process, there's nothing there to say if you opt out, you can't go back....I think that's unclear and might spook people a little. If you say these are your options and the rammifications of those options I think that would help. 

C: Do you think there is anything else to add to make it simpler?

P: Track the status of your claim, disclaimer to wait maybe 30 days to check the status of your claim. Gives VA time to process it. Even if it just says 'under review' might satisfy some people. I think it would be better if you had a time frame there...30 days would not be unreasonable.

C: Other feedback?

P: I don't believe so! I really like it, I think it would be used well and a streamlined process for the user to submit a Higher Level Review. I like it.
