# Notes for Participant 7 - Higher Level Review

## Intro - 5 minutes

C: Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the appeals process on VA.gov, specifically an appeals process that we call a Higher Level Review. Have you heard of that before?

P: Actually I'm getting ready to make one, so this will be great for me.

C: So it's really relevant for you right now. 

**Christian goes through setup items - removed for brevity's sake**


## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)

- Lets spend a few minutes now, were I send you the prototype of the website we will look at today.

- Now I'm going to share a link to the prototype in the zoom chat. Can you find the chat button in the Zoom app? 
- Great, can you click on it? There should be a link you can click on there. 
- Can you navigate back to the Zoom window and click the "Share" button in Zoom? 

*We go through the process of screen sharing*

**Warm Up Questions**



**1st screen: Intro HLR page**

C: Imagine you've come to this page, you've logged in, and you've come here. What is the purpose and what would you do on this page?

P: When you come here, you have to opt out of the old appeals process, and that's not clear. I may have multiple appeals happening at the same time...for example, I have [several appeals]...so telling me I am withdrawing from those appeals is not the right thing to say. This also implies that I have to opt out. You would have to identify what it is, that's, just right off the bat...you could have more than one appeal going on and, so...let me try the steps below...[speaks to self]...ok. Here's where I have a general issue with the VA - the list of issues you have and the decision for each. Access to that should be available. Log in, have a list of decisions and be able to select one or two. I go on VA.gov I cannot get my decision papers. They're not posted. After there's a ruling, they block that information. I haven't seen anywhere they make that available or not.

C: Would you expect that this information is available to you?

P: I wouldn't know at this point...I'd need to read down.. [reads]

C: What do you expect to see if you clicked on facility locator?

P: I guess I would expect to put my information in and be able to find VA locations near me. If I have a VSO...you, VA, should know who that is. It should say 'contact YOUR VSO' if there's one assigned.

C: And what do you expect to see for get help for a decision review?

P: A list of VSOs, what they would do for me. Here's what your VSO can do. You can print this for your records...that's fine....125 days...that's ok. You can get your decision in the mail...I know you get your decision in the mail but it should be available online.

C: So you would like both the decision and review letters to be available online?

P: Absolutely! I assume now I start the Higher Level Review application?

C: Yes, but tell me what you'd expect when you click on that button?

P: I'd expect to see some form where I fill out information. I would expect it to be like the 20-0996 form show up. I think there's another form that goes with it, but I'll have to go through this and see what it has.



**2nd screen: Opt out page**

C: Take a look at this page and the main purpose and what you can do.

P: again, my same comment applies...I need to specify which appeal, which claim I'm doing, in case I have multiple claims. This is inadequate for those who have multiple claims. See 'view all your contested issues'...that would imply I've already filed an appeal or something...you might not have it active. Again, how that button there fits in to being able to opt out of a particular appeal, you need to find an answer there.

C: What if you clicked on 'all contested isuses'?

P: I would expect to see...the original claim, then they come back with a decision letter, then the next step is you've got three things: Supplemental Claim, Higher Level Review, and I forget what it is...go to court type of thing. Court option. This is why I'm saying, I got a decision review back, and I can't see it yet, so I dunno if that's gonna show up again or not. This also applies if I'm in the old appeals process, which I may not be. Maybe if you could view all your things, and then opt out, opt out. I would hate to opt out of everything and then have an appeal totally unrelated to this, then saying that was opted out.

C: So for you to feel comfortable moving forward, what info would you need on this page?

P: On this page, I need to have the decision papers for what I'm appealing. The findings. So I need to know what those are. So I can know which appeal is going to the Higher Review level and so on and so forth.

C: Got it. Any other comments?

P: Nope, I think I'm good here.

C: Ok, so you can continue.

    
**3nd screen: Personal Info**    

P: Veteran detail...this is the info we have on file for you...finish app later, that's fine...

C: before you continue, anything here confusing or unclear?

P: Not on this one. This is fine.

C: You can continue.



**4th screen: Contact Info**    

C: Tell me what you see on this page.

P: Contact info we have on file for you...address updates you might make...phone and email [thinking, talking out loud]...Umm I would say, unless they're actually gonna email me which I know they won't, I would say thy are gonna SEND the information to that address. I think they mail because of HIPAA, but the new rules do allow you to put HIPAA information on a secure site. I've seen it take 2.5 weeks from the date the letter was sent to get to me. Having gone through this, this is not your form, but why the hell don't they make things available to us? My doctor, all kinds of providers get information online, so anyway...ok I agree with it...

C: What would you expect to see on the profile page?


P: That's the standard VA profile page...your address, your standard...malarkey on. My question is...if I go to my profile page...so this says I can edit here, but this only applies for this page and this appeal. If I now go to my profile page, what's the process I have to go through to get to this information?

C: Do you think you can update your profile information?

P: Oh I KNOW that.

C: Do you think this would update the profile page?

P: Oh it's not clear.

C: What would you expect or hope to see?

P: I'd prefer to be able to update this here, instead of having a button to go to update my profile information. If I click on the button, I will lose this page, and I may lose this information. So the ideal situation would be to change this info, then have the ability to apply this to my profile page. That would be the most user friendly approach. Otherwise I'd have to bring up the profile page and then I'd need a 'back to the appeals page' button on my profile page. Or third case is that the third link here is set up to bring the profile page in a new window - not just a new tab - a new window. Then a new button that says update data or update page. In other words, right here. From a programmers point of view, that's probably the easiest thing to do. 

C: Any other comments?

P: Nope, I think I'm good.

    
**5th screen: Contested Issues**
    
P: Items that are eligible for HLR....(sighs)..okay. I don't know how they got this. If this is an extract...if this is all of my appeals and claims, and all of the items are listed here, then I'm ok with it. 

C: So what items so you expect to see listed here?

P: You send in multiple claims, and they give you a ruling on each of those things, each one of those can be appealed. I can do a supplemental or a higher level appeal. I would expect that entire list of everything I've claimed because they might find for me but no disability, higher disability rating - but everything they've made a rating on, I'd expect to see here. At least all those within 18 months. I would expect to find everything I've claimed and it's status. 

C: Take a look at that text and let me know if that's what you expected to see.

P: Well I have one problem with this because this is a replacement for this form. This says on the very first page that this is a substitute for the [old form]. You could say this is only for health ussues, but from what I read on the first page that I am filling out a 20-0996 form. Now here's...see, see all your issues...if this is a historical list, more than a year old, then I guess that's what I expected to see.

C: So here you'd expect to see all your issues going back to the beginning of time?

P: Yes, I knew that, but the person might not always know that. 

C: Let me see what you'd do on this page if you needed to make a claim for your Tinnitus.

P: I'd click on this...let me think about something...I want to see the don't see the issue. There's a possibility that I have papers in my hand that are less than a year old and for some reason, are not on this list. So nothing is addressed [in that case]...if it's not there, then what do I do? It says it might not be in our system, but it's in your decision letter. 

C: So what would you expect to see then?

P: Yeah maybe a phone number, or an email. But have you ever tried to call the VA?

C: No, I have not.

P: It's a 45min-1.5 hr wait. I'm just telling ya. Instead of calling them, it could be a hell of a lot more efficient for everybody.

**6th screen: Notes**

C: Ok so tell me what's going on on this page.

P: Ok, definitely cannot have a max number of characters, particularly not 400. I mean I'm preparing a HLR because the initial review was refusing to take my paperwork that I tried to hand her, show it to her. That alone probably takes more than 400 characters. So this - maybe if you wanted to do 2000 or something like that. Either that, brief summary here, or you can...allow the to attach a description. Ok, so if you could upload and attach a description. But definitely more than 400 characters. now, what if I had new and relevant information...

C: That link does not work but how does that change the perception of this page?

P: having gone through this process I know that you cannot submit new evidence for an HLR, so this almost should've been a question right at the very front. I think there was some info upfront, but you have two choices. You can either choose to not submit the new evidence or you have to go through another process.

C: Do you feel that info was clear in the beginning or should be made more clear?

P: I think that was called out in the front but having it here as well to reinforce to click them out and say 'you're in the wrong thing' as a backup. It's ok to have this button here...

C: Sure, let's go to the next thing.


**7th screen: Same Office**

P: Kinda straightforward....

C: What do you think is the prupose of this page?

P: Well some people may think the office has it in for them, or the office is a bunch of boobs, for some reason, they want someone else to conduct the review. You certainly can have the option.

C: Imagine you click 'no' here. What are you thinking as you read this text?

P: Ok, that's fine. 

C: So is anything unclear or confusing on this page.

P: Rules are what they are and fully explained.


**8th screen: Informal Conference**

C: Tell me whats going on on this page.

P: With today's technology...I question why you can't have both you AND your rep. Now, it might be...if you want to have your rep meet with you...but my iphone will let me call two people. It shouldnt be an either/or. THis should be you/your rep or both. 

C: So let's click on yes call me.

P: Ok, what two time periods should I select?

C: You can click 12:30 but what do you think will happen next?

P: Umm, wel I would expect to go to the next page. What I would really expect that I would get an email or a letter telling me which time, just saying 'schedule a time'...you're telling me it can take up 125 days. You're saying in the next 3 months, you're gonna try to call me any day between 12:30 and 2. In this day and age, they should be able to set up something in advance, or have more choices, which days of the week, which days are good, and which time periods are good.

C: So when they call, would you expect the call is the informal conference or the call is to set uo the informal conference?

P: Oh, sorry...I thought this was for the actual conference. Ok, so I didn't see that. So this is calling them to set up the conference. I think you should have more precision. I misread it.

C: That's very common, actually. So what do you think about that?

P: Put a title here, or choose a time to set up your conference. Or set up conference time. And say 'set up two time periods we can schedule'.

C: That makes it more clear.

P: Makes it more clear.

C: More comments on this page?

P: Nope, we can move on.

**9th screen: Review**

C: What do you see here?

P: Ok, I expect I could click on veteran's detail...

C: So in the prototype it'll open all boxes for you...the real website would open each individually.

P: that's fine. So I was expecting to see things like zip/postal code. Oh you do have the country...most of these are going to be in the US. Here, if you take my suggestion for attachments, you could reopen and check to make sure everything was there. And again, whatever you decide to do with availablity slot, that would be reflected in here. I'd still like to see an email option rather than a phone call. Oh, hold on a moment, someone's calling me...

*user takes phone call*

P: You there? 

C: Yup, I'm here.

P: Ok, it was someone trying to phish me.

C: Ah, ok. Anything unclear here?

P: I think this wraps it up. I'm surprised this is so simple a document. Yeah, you know what? I'd like to have a page that says 'this is the evidence we have for this case' so I can check it. That's my concern. What're you gonna look at? I don't know. With my Supplemental claim, I could see the stuff I was uploading. So there should be a link to the page, to all the evidence so you can make sure there's a complete record. That's what's missing from all this.

C: Exactly, that makes a lot of sense. Let's go ahead and move on.

P: I think I'm fine - I have to click I accpet the policy. Now I can submit..



**10th screen: submit**

C: What would you expect to see if you clicked on 'learn more'?

P: Essentially a narrative about what happens, why it takes 125 days, what should I do while I wait...shouldn't do anything...learn more about what happens. Yeah just an explanation as to why the 125 days. 

P: Track the status...I would expect to see where it is...

C: Show where it is...?

P: Yeah, just here where it says 'track the status of your claim or appeal'... when I saw this, just said it was received, it was in review and that was about it. It would be nice to know where I am in the [paper] stack. If I said I didn't want it with the original office, but there's no saying where it's going. Because I thought you could do an in person thing, but maybe they ruled that out now. I dont know what status you have that's relevant to the user. But tell you the time it would take to get to the top of the pile, or the bottom of the pile.  Just something that's usable by the user. 

**Final Questions**

C: This is the last page. Can I ask you two questions now?

P: Sure!

C: What do you think about it overall?

P: it's fairly smooth and consistent. I forget what the other one was...but there were a bunch of permutations. This one is straightforward...however, I feel like the issues need to be explained to the extent they need explaining...second of all, can I make sure that all the evidence is there, that I know what the evidence is and you have it all. 

C: What was most confusing about this flow?

P:The only one I can remember that was somewhat confusing was updating your contact info. That seemed to take you out of the flow, and I couldn't remember how to get back into the flow. My concern was that you went someplace and I wasn't sure you could easily get back.

C: Last question: What do you think was most helpful as a user, in the flow?

P: First of all, just being able to do it online. Cause I have a hell of a time submitting all this stuff. Again, if the links are there so you can see the decision papers, ecvidence and all that, so you can look it up.

C: Last part of the interview: Last comments or feedback?

P: Nope, I enjoyed doing it, and I'd do it again!

C: Great! We got lots of great feedback.
