# Notes for Participant 8 - Higher Level Review

## Intro - 5 minutes

C: Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the appeals process on VA.gov, specifically an appeals process that we call a Higher Level Review. 

**Christian goes through setup items - removed for brevity's sake**


## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)

- Lets spend a few minutes now, were I send you the prototype of the website we will look at today. 
- First, please minimize or close any windows that you don't want to share with us.
- Now I'm going to share a link to the prototype in the zoom chat. Can you find the chat button in the Zoom app? 
- Great, can you click on it? There should be a link you can click on there. 
- Can you navigate back to the Zoom window and click the "Share" button in Zoom? 

*We go through the process of screen sharing*

**Warm Up Questions**

Before we look at the prototype of the website, letâ€™s start with a few general questions.

C: Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of prompts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)

P: I did do an interview like this before, umm..last year, maybe, at least 6 months ago if not a bit longer. My residence is in [state] and I use the [region], mostly [city] VA. 

C: How was that interview?

P: It was good, it was very positive. I felt like, maybe it was supposed to be a 20 minute interview, but it went on for about an hour. I felt like I was listened to, and the questions were relevant.

C: Great, that's good to hear. 

C: Have you filed an disability claim with the VA?

C: How was that process?

P: It was very easy. Umm, I didn't really have any problem with it but I'd done a lot of research. It was just easy...submitted the form, new evidence, and that was it!
 
C: How about the VSO in 2009?
 
P: It was horrible. It was not good. I didn't have a vewry supportive VSO person.
 
C: I'm sorry to hear about that.



**1st screen: Intro HLR page**

C: So imagine that you come to this page. A benefit you have applied for (Tinnitus) has been denied. How would you go about disputing this decision? 

P: The first thing I generally do is read the whole page. So I don't click on anything right away, I just read through to see if there's any specific instructions that might sneak in near the bottom before you click in. And then, before I start HLR, I would go through step-by-step to see if there were any links, then I would click on 'learn more on review options'?

C: What would you expect to see there? If you clicked on review options?

P: I guess I would look for more details on the instructions. Like maybe a picture of the application self, so I can see how it could be filled out because sometimes the forms can be confusing. Even with like, bullets saying 'you put down your experience or whatever it is'. I would say the thing I look for most would be a form with an explanation on how to fill out the form. I see it says 'get help filling out application' and I would use that as kinda a 'part B' of what I would do. If I still needed more help and didn't understand, I would click on that link and follow the directions. For facility locator tool, I would think there would be a listing of all facilities and somewhere you could put in your zip code and find the closest faciltiies in your area.

C: Anything else about this page?

P: I guess under 'apply', I would kinda assume that I had to click on the word apply because it seems like there's nothing to click on here, so then what? It just says apply...the list in general is, follow these steps. It would be easier if under the apply it showed the actual application that you needed to fill out.

C: Yup, so what would you do at this point?

P: I would then click on start the HLR applcation.

C: You can go ahead and do that.



**2nd screen: Opt out page**

C: what's the purpose of this page and what would you do here?

P: I think if, umm...hmm. Since I'd have to assume anybody getting to this page has submitted a claim and has been turned downn or percentage is too low, it would be someone who is familiar with the claims process. I think it would be understood that you're kinda stopping your previous claim in order to send it in for the review. That it's not necessarily starting a new claim but its freezing it somehow to move forward.

P: It seems like this would freeze your current applications and then step back once in the application, that's what it seems like to me. The only thing that is a little confusing to me, when it says opt out of the old appeals systems, it seems like someone whuld have to go through the old appeals system to even know what that was. So if this was an initial claim that was denied, they wouldn't necessarily know what the old appeals system was. So youre opting out of the old one and going into the new one...it's a little confusing that you don't know what youre opting out of. 

C: So what would you conclude or how would you interpret this yourself?

P: The first line underneath it...you'll have to opt out from the old appeals process. That kinda gives you an instruction but it doesn't tell you why...it reminds me of software agreements where if you don't agree you can't use it. 

C: What do you think of that?

P: I would phrase it more of a positive. to request an HLR, you would need to use this form for any current appeals process. Instead of an opt out, more like an opt in, I guess? This sounds like you are already on track for an appeals process, unless this is maybe a second appeal, this doesn't really make sense. In the box you check off, I think that might scare people...oh my gosh, what might happen to my claim? It's gonna go into the abyss and get lost, so that could be scary for some people who are..you know not everybody is comfortable with the claims process. 

C: Anything else that's confusing?

P: Well, along the scary line "I understand that decision is permanent" it has just a finality to it, and I think that line could be scary to certain people who are not familiar with the claims process. And who is familiar to it, if it's their first time doing it? The wording might be discouraging.

C: So if you were on this page, and had these thoughts about it being scary, and you were new, what would you do in this situation?

P: If it was possible, like on the previous page it said you could get help, if there could be another button saying something like 'I don't understand what this means'...could this be explained a little bit more. So somebody could feel a little more comfortable signing things. 

C: So any other comments before we move on?

P: No, that's it!
    
**3nd screen: Personal Info**    

C: Tell me what you see here.

P: I have become Alessandra Baker! I like that! Born in 1980 - I'm 30 years younger! (laughs)

C: Yeah, time machine!

P: Yeah, I like this. Just to update your information, you can't just click it, you need to call. That may be safer. would it show time and service?

C: You would expect to see time and service here?

P: Yeah.

C: Anything confusing here?

P: I don't think so...if it was still working regionally, with regional offices, otherwise I would say you need to put in a location. So maybe yeah, just service or years in service or something.

C: Yeah, ok so we can move on.


**4th screen: Contact Info**    

C: What do you see here?

P: Yup! That all looks fine. I like that it has the opportunity to edit if you need to edit it. And then there's a link to the profile page. I think that looks fine.

C: What would you expect to see on the profile page?


P: I would say almost to the previous page. Maybe with a little more information. I'm not sure what kind of info. It would almost seem redundant to go to my profile page and back,. I feel like both of them might go there.

C: If you edit here, would you expect this would edit the info on the profile page?

P: Yes, yes I would. I would expect it to update anywhere in the process that would have that information. Where it had a primary phone, address, email...even if in 4 different places, that it would change in those places.

C: Anything else that's confusing?

P: It's not confusing, I would say...the only other thing, but would have to do later, if there werre dependents, spouse or children, or next of kin info. Not sure if that would be relevant in this point of the process.

C: So no more comments, we can move on.

    
**5th screen: Contested Issues**
    
C: Tell me what you see here.

P: Ok...I mean that seems pretty...self explanatory. And then I'm assuming that the part underneath that says 'dont see what you're looking for' that it brings up other issues you've claimed for that aren't listed, or other things you hadn't asked for. But I think this is pretty clear. These are the issues that I had on my form or that I initially put in, that I'm verifying. So I'm rated at 10% but I want 50% so I'd check that off.

C: So what would you expect to see if you clicked on that link?

P: maybe it would show you issues that you

C: Go ahead annd click on it.

P: Ok so that answers my question of what wouldn't be listed, so if I claimed 5 things and only see 2, then I would see those other 3 things listed there. Or maybe if it was for some other benefit type. I would just assume it wouldn't be listed. So that answers that question. 

C: So is there anything in this link that is not 100% clear?

P: Ummm...the only one that's a little confusing is the second bullet - if it's for another benefit type. I'm not sure if I'd understand exactly what that meant. If it's for another benefit type, where do I go? Is this the end of the line? So I'm not sure how to clarify that because I find that confusing.

C: Yes, ok so I'll ask you to move to the next one.


**6th screen: Notes**

C: So tell me what you think the purpose of this page is.

P: I'm laughing because they use anything they can type into because they vent everything they think the VA should know about anything. They might use it as a contact form for about anything. But I would say - that's kinda hard - because I do have Tinnitus and I know what that is. I would reiterate that it was affecting my daily life, my work, maybe I had to take time off from work. From whatever the condition might be and how it's preventing me from living normally. That it's really interfering. That's what I'd do for any issue. I would also - I'm assuming that I have a written decision that tells me why I was denied or given a small amount of 10%. I would take that into consideration and if my review on the claim said it does not seem to impact your daily life. I would take that into consideration, and I would tell them that there are some things that affect my daily life that weren't taken into consideration.

C: What info is appropriate to add to this page and not appropriate?

P: Maybe add a line that says, using the decision you got, how do you disagree with it? Something that would encourage them to look at their decision and read it because too many people don't. They rant about how they got turned down. 

C: Do you think this is a page where you can upload new evidence or not?

P: well underneath the box it says 'what if I have new and relevant evidence'? I would assume if I clicked on that there might be a link to an upload process? Where it might say 'if you do have new evidence click here and you can upload from your computer' or something.

C: Actually with HLR, it's not possible to upload or add new evidence. When you know that it's not possible to upload new evidence, does that change how you'd use this page or not?

P: If I click on new and relevant evidence, does something come up?


**7th screen: Same Office**

P: That's clear.

C: Do you think you'd click yes or no here and why?

P: Reflex action would be yes, because if they wanted me to come into a location, I could do that. But if I had a problem with the claim, I might hit no, but if it could be determined in CA and I'm in [state across the country], I'd say no.

C: Try to click on no.

P: Ok, yeah. I would assume that if it couldn't be handled, they'd let me know. It says we'll notify you if a decision is made. It's pretty clear but there's not really a - like an option - unless you just hit yes. The only other thing, why don't you want it at the same office? Just asking. Because maybe its a reason that could be addressed. 

C: In this case, choose no, and go to the next page.


**8th screen: Informal Conference**

C: Tell me what you would do here.

P: If it were a Skype type thing, that you're requesting to actually talk to a person, or possibly have an agent with you of some sort. I would think that it could be in a VSP pffice using their contact. This is just that you're requesting to not have it done just by sending in your paperwork. You want someone to speak to.

C: Try to click 'yes call me'.

P: So now it comes on with times, time periods...yup, that's clear. 

C: If you click on 12:30 here, before you click continue, what do you think will happen if you choose this step?

P: I would check two of the time periods, then I would think...maybe you would reverse these two paragraphs. I would expect someone would contact me either by email or phone to verify those time slots.

C: When they call would it be to set up the time for an informal conference or for the conference itself?

P: It would be to set up a time..and date! It doesn't really say anything about any day of the week...that might be helpfiul.

C: So you would expect them to call within the next 30 days?

P: Oh I misunderstood...oh so these are the times you would want someone to be available to receive the call. I thought this was times for the informal conference. But this is really for someone to call you and then set up the appointnemnt.

C: So what do you think about that?

P: uhhh...huh. I still think maybe reversing those paragraphs might make it more clear. I'm not sure how much clearer the wording could be for that though. I don't have something definitive to say (laughs).

C: Let's choose 12:30. Take a look at this text and tell me if it's helpful or not.

P: It's clear, it's a little umm...abrupt. If you don't asnwer, we're just gonna move on. But that's what you gotta do. 

C: Ok, so let's continue. Tell me what you see on this page.


**9th screen: Review**

P: This looks like....a review application. So it's all the previous pages, so you would look through all this data and make sure it's all accurate.

C: So what would you do on this page?

P: I would look through all of them. Do you want me to do that?

C: Yes.

P: It has edit button, for your phone number....maybe an alternate phone number? Because you're dealing with disabled people and some are more disabled than others. Other than that, it looks exactly like what I expected it to look like. I can edit information if I need to.

C: Anything confusing or unclear or missing?

P: I don't see anything. It would just be double checking to make sure everything is correct. It's very clear.

C: You can go ahead and submit.

**10th screen: submit**

C: And then take a look at this page and if anything is unclear or missing on this page.

P: [Laughs at what should I do while I wait]...but that all looks pretty clear. I would only say that maybe on this page or other page, encourage them to print it out! Even if it's just for your records so you have proof of what you did. It's not something people automatically do, so I encourage people to do that. 

C: I just want to say that we are on time now, but do you have a couple minutes to answer a couple more questions?

P: Sure.

C: Ok, so do you have any other comments for this page?

P: No, I think it's mostly good. I would suggest maybe a save or print button.


**Final Questions**

C: what did you think overall for this process?

P: I think it's basically pretty easy. It's a lot easier than when I was doing it. I had a lot of questions. If I wasn't, it explains the process along the way. I think it's relatively easy. 

C: What was most confusing?

P: Umm....I think in the beginning, like where I said 'an example of the form' if they had questions about filling out the form. I think it might be confusing without it. 

C: Ok, anything else?

P: We talked about the profile page, years of service. Things like that might be important. Just kind of an additional verification. 

C: What was particularly helpful?

P: I think when it was like, these are the things that qualified for an appeal and when it told you why something wasn't listed, I thought that was helpful.

C: Great! Thank you so much for participating and giving us valuable feedback.
