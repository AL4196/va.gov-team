**1st screen: 
Intro HLR page**


C: what can you do on this page?

P: Well, it says you can request a higher level review, and it has places to click on to, let's say, start the process.

C: Is there anything confusing or unclear?

P: No, not really. It looks pretty simple to me.

C: Would you say anything is missing on this page?

P: That I couldn't tell ya.

C: Imagine now that you are coming to this page and you have a benefit you are applying for (ringing in ears - called Tinnitus) that has been denied. So you come into this page, log in. So tell me what you do to go through this process.

P: Well, read the instructions, obviously. Then go down to the bottom of the page and click start the higher level review application.

C: What would you expect to see if you clicked on that?

P: It would have the application on it, you know. And a fill in form. 

C: Go ahead and click on that.


**2nd screen: Opt out page**


C: Let me know what you see on this page and its purpose is.

P: First quastion says opt out of old appeals system. You'd have to click on the opt out and then continue.

C: Is this 100% clear for you what this page means?

P: Well the instructions say you are opting out of the old process and you're reuqesting it's being reviewed under the new appeals process review. If you click on this you know what's gonna happen. You're going to go into the new appeals process.

C: When you're looking at this page, is there anything unclear about it?

P: No.

C: If you were to click the opt out, are you 100% clear on what that would mean?

P: Yes.

C; Any other comments?

P: Nah, no.

C: You can click continue.

P: Now they're requesting contact information. 

C: So anything confusing on this page?

P: No, very easy to understand.

C: Anything on this page that is particularly helpful?

P: No, it's pretty much how you find the VA forms all the time, you know?

C: So it's pretty clear to you?

P: Oh yeah!
    
**5th screen: Contested Issues**
    
C: What can you do on this page?

P: Well, it shows two different issues, tinnitus and headaches, depending on which one you're doing it for, you have to click on the proper place.

C: What if you had other issues you didn't see on this page?

P: The issue that was denied was tinnitus, so I would just go with tinnitus and go onto the next page.
