## Notes 
**The moderator is in bold**

### 1st screen: Intro HLR page
-Ok great, now lets take a look at the prototype of the website.

**Intro questions: take a look at this page and tell me what you think the main purpose of this page is, and what actions can you take on this page?**<br>
Request a Higher-level review. It’s right up front. It looks like it goes, “start the..” it’s gonna guide me through the request for a higher-level review. And then steps and go through, hit the button to start the higher-level review I guess. 

**Tell me if something on this page os confusing or unclear.**<br>
If I click start the review process, I’m not sure what that will do in regards to being able to take a look at the four steps. I don’t know if that button, oh it is underneath. I don’t know if it should be above it. I might click that before reading the entire page. 

**Makes sense for it to only be on the bottom?**<br>
Yes, or else there’s a good chance I’d click that before reading. 

**When you look at this page, is there anything confusing or unclear?**<br>
I’m reading the rest of this stuff, I’m sorry. No, it’s pretty straightforward. I think the key is you’re setting an expectation that you should be able to get the review completed in 125 days. 

**What do you expect to see after you click?**<br>
Uhm, a screen that would have me start filling in information. I wouldn’t expect to see the form itself, but not along the lines of a TurboTax type of screen asking me to input information. The end result would be a completed form.

(Provide user with the necessary context for a Higher Level Review appeals process).

### 1st screen: Intro HLR page

**What do you think is the main purpose of this page, and how well do you think this page accomplishes this purpose? What would you do on this page?**<br>
Not the page I thought I’d get, so let me just… *reading* It’s kinda like a curveball because the first thing I’m being asked if opting out of the old appeals system. That should have been discussed before I ever hit the start button to fill out the form.

**Is it clear what will happen if you continue?**<br>
I think what’s missing here is why should I do this if I happened to have an old appeal? I don’t see any benefit explanation. All I’m being asked is if I want to opt out of the old system.

**Where would you expect to see the explanation?**<br>
Before I’m asked to make this decision. All of this should be asked before I ask to submit a Higher-level review request. 

**What make you comfortable to choose to opt out here? What information do you need to be comfortable going through this step**<br>
There should be some listing why I should do this. Is it gonna accelerate the time to get a decision on the review? I just don’t... there really is no explanation why I should go to the new system here.

**Any other questions or concerns you have?**<br>
No, that’s the big one. 

**Show me what you would do**<br>
I would hit this box and click continue 

### 2nd screen: Opt out page

**How do you interpret the content of this page?**<br>
This is what I was expecting to pop up the first time I clicked to move forward. So now this is just verifying personal identification information.

**Before you click continue, is there anything confusing or unclear?**<br>
Well, I guess I would expect the information to be accurate. I’m surprised that if it isn’t accurate that I would have to make a phone call. 

**What would you expect instead of that? What would you hope for?**<br>
I would hope for, in reading and reviewing and it wasn’t accurate I would get an edit button that would enable you to rectify the discrepancy and not have to wait Monday through Friday from 8 - 9 pm.

**Please go ahead and click on the Continue button.**

### 3rd screen: Personal Info

**Tell me what you see on this page, and what you think you can do here.**<br>
Okay, straightforward on phone number and mailing address. Here it does, it enables me to correct that by going to my profile page. 

**Before you click on that, this link is not working, if you were able to go to your profile page, what would you expect?**<br>
I guess I got a question: It says that you need to go to profile page or hit edit to make changes?

**What do you expect?**<br>
I would expect if I wanted to change primary phone number I should be able to hit edit and change it there and not have to go to my profile page. I would think in doing the edit, it would be the update as well.

**What do you think about the possibility to edit it on this page?**<br>
I think you need to have that. It’s imperative to be able to ensure you have the right contact information.

**Why do you think you have the possibility to edit contact information but not able to edit your personal information on the previous page?**<br>
Maybe because the problem with SSN is I can understand if someone could make that changes and commit fraud. I just, once you get started on a computer and have to get off a computer and start calling people it just prolongs submitting the request for HLR

**You are thinking if you do an edit to the contact information, do you expect that to be update on. profile page?**<br>
I would expect that. Otherwise you have to make the change twice.

**Any other comments?**<br>
No

**Please continue.**<br>

### 4th screen: Contact Info

**What do you see on this page?**<br>
I’m gonna make the assumption that these are the two conditions that I am asking for a change. I guess I’m asking for a change since I have a current rating. I would, whatever I click on whether it’s tinnitus or headaches which one I was appealing. Or I’d hit, don’t see the issue I’m looking for.

**What would you expect to see if you open don’t see an issue link?**<br>
I would have to believe it would be all the other, everything I had ever submitted for. Whether it was approved or disapproved, it would list all the conditions I was once claiming.

**You can open that little link. Tell me if what you see is what you expected or not.**<br>
That’s not what I was expecting. I was expecting to see the issues. I wasn’t expecting to see an explanation. Why wouldn’t that explanation be on the previous slide? Underneath where it says below is the list of issues that are eligible. It would make more sense to have that explanation there and not to click. I was expecting to see the issues.

**When you look at this text, is there anything unclear or confusing?**<br>
Let me read it again. Well, not that, I guess if I’m three clicks into this form and I dunno the issue about pension or compensation issues, it should be explained well in advance of starting the form. I think that needs to be introduced much earlier than in this particular slide.

**Can you say a little more about why you think that?**<br>
I think, the whole idea was that I wanted to submit a higher-level review for pension, I feel like I’ve wasted a little bit of time here and now have to go somewhere else or do another form.

**You see the button, see all your issues, what would you expect to see?**<br>
I would expect to see all the issues like I said earlier. I guess everything within the last year. I would expect to see it populated. 

**Imagine that you are on this page. and you are appealing for tinnitus. Show what you would do**<br>
Hit tinnitus and hit continue. 

### 5th screen: Contested Issues
**Take a look at this page and tell me what you think the purpose of the page is.**<br>
I guess this is my opportunity to justify why an appeal is needed. I would also think it would be a place I could insert new evidence to substantiate my appeal.
**You see the button down there. What if I have new and relevant evidence. You can go ahead and tell me what you think, why that is there**<br>
Because I think, in any appeal I’m probably going to have other medical information that I want to submit. This would be my opportunity to upload that. I think if I click this, it would be a traditional set of instructions on how to upload another file or two. 

**What if I tell you that this page where you have a field you can add text, this is actually not a page for you to add new evidence. The text you can put into this form is not meant for new evidence, it’s more meant for you to write and comment on your case. There’s not possible on this page to upload new relevant evidence. In order to do that, you will have to click on this link, and it will explain where to go to do that?**<br>
The whole purpose upon submitting a review is because you don’t agree with the decision you received. You got it wrong. I would think if you want the decision to be changed, you would want to go into writing relevant information other than I think you got it wrong. You almost have to start including relevant information that you want things to be changed. Yeah, you guys made the wrong decision, here’s why. That why is gonna be irrelevant information.

**If you’re not able to upload new and relevant evidence for this page, would you use this page? And how would you use it?**<br>
You’re gonna discuss the relevant information. I don’t know how if you’re going to contest something. I believe the 10% rating I received is incorrect, is provides much greater problem to me than a 10% rating would indicate. I can describe how the condition is negatively impacting my ability to work and my life. Maybe that’s what I’d put there. At some point I’d have to substantiate that other than with my text. 

**When you go to this page, your first thought that this was a page you could add new and relevant evidence?**<br>
I clicked on the last one that this is a condition I’m appealing, I’m going right into the appeal.

**Do you think this is a page you would use?**<br>
I couldn’t leave it blank, I’d have to use it. I would kind of feel if, I don’t know. If I can’t submit new information, maybe there needs to be further explanation when I’m gonna be able to do that. 

**Please go ahead and hit Continue.**

### (5.5 screen - just info about the flow)

**What would you do on this page?**<br>
Would you like the same office to conduct prior review? I would say no. That’s an interesting choice I’m given. I don’t know fi that means it will happen that way, or. If I’m requesting a higher-level review my initial assumption means the same office issuing the prior decision wouldn’t be adjudicating the appeal. I would click no.

**Take a look at that information and how you would find that.**<br>
I guess, I don’t like what I’m reading cuz it’s wishy washy. Again, when I read, “Would you like the same office to conduct the review”, an office consists of many different employees and what I wouldn’t want to have happen is if Joe Smith made the decision on my initial decision, I wouldn’t want Joe Smith to be the one adjudicating my higher-level review. This just says the same office. I don’t know. Would you like the same office that issued prior decision to conduct the review, I understand that there can only be one office that did it but I don’t know.. I guess I’m talking around myself what the point of asking this question is if you can’t do it. I guess somewhere reading about the higher-level review it would say that the folks adjudicating it originally would not be making the decision on the higher-level review.

**On this page as it is now, you click on no. And then you get this information.**<br>
If you’re asking me a question yes or no, and then the next thing I get is we may be able to do it, you shouldn’t have asked me the question.

### 6th screen: Request informal conference

**What do you think you can do here?**<br>
Okay, I would click yes, I would just have to figure out if it was my best interest to call me or my representative. But this is all before I’ve given you any information right?

**We assume that you are logged into this website. So, there is information in your account. You can assume -**<br>
I’m talking about the information the substantiates a different outcome for the higher-level review.

**If you only have gone through this flow and haven’t done anything else, it would not be any additional evidence. Of course, you can have that submitted in other ways. Is that what you mean?**<br>
I just think.. uhm… the higher-level review I should be able to give information if it’s warranted before I’m asked whether or not I can do an informal conference.

**So let’s say you have taken care of that, you have sent in that additional information, and you want them to call you. Go ahead and go through this step. Now you will be asked another part. Let me know if anything here is unclear or confusing.**<br>
I think it’s pretty straightforward. The only question I have is there’s one phone number I submitted earlier and I don’t know if that may be the phone number I may want to have this conversation. There would have to be.. for instance if I wanted them to call my representative I would provide that number.

**Imagine that you are choosing one of these time options and then you click continue, what do you think will happen then? What will be the next thing that will happen?**<br>
Again, I still think I have to submit some relevant information. Maybe I’m focused on that. At some point there’s gonna be a submit button. I could finish the application later, but at some point I’m gonna hit submit. I’m getting close to that I believe.

**What do you think about this information conference? Let’s say you pick 12:30 and without clicking continue click 12:30. Let me know what you think will happen specifically with this informal conference that you are requesting**<br>
An individual will call and speak to me and at some point, I’ve read your request is there any further information you would like to tell me that would give me greater insight into what I’m asking for?

**When they call and you have that phone call, what is the purpose of that phone call do you think?**<br>
I think the purpose is an opportunity for the veteran to have a chance to present his or her case.

**When they call, that is the informal conference or something else?**<br>
I think that’s what it’s gonna result in. We’ll contact you to schedule an informal conference.. that’s what I would use it for if I was the veteran. I would ensure that the individual calling me if there’s any area of what I’ve submitting you that needs to be strengthened. I think this would be an opportunity to update the package if it needed to be. If there was a glaring error or it needed further substantiation.

**This call that youre talking about, when they call you back do you think that is the informal conference or schedule a time for the informal conference?**<br>
I just read it again and you’re right! I thought this was the time for the informal conference.

**What do you think about this page and this process when you know that information?**<br>
I just realized something. There’s no date here. So, okay… so this is.. did I miss that? We will call you during this time block but there’s no specific date. This isn’t very good. So this means when I hit the send button any day following I can get a call between 12:30 - 2. What day? Even if you wanted a day to schedule the call, you need to have a date so the individual is not left hanging. I don’t know… if the representative is involved they may want to have the call with their representative. I see the benefit of calling to set up the call, but it’s gotta be on a specific date otherwise this is an open-ended and ridiculous evolution.

### 7th screen: Review application
**Take a look at this page and tell me what you see here.**<br>
I guess I’m gonna get to review the application, so I have to click on each of the plus signs and read then information I inputted.

**The only one that is active is the top box called Veteran Details. You can click on that. Now it will open all the boxes, normally it will open one at a time. Look through this page and tell me what you think about this page. And if anything is confusing or unclear.**<br>
I have no idea what that information is typed in under tinnitus. I don’t know what that example is trying to indicate because no veteran is going to have that information. 

**Just imagine this is description, in English, of tinnitus.**<br>
Okay. Okay, just reviewing everything inputted at that time. But I do think the request for an informal… okay that’s misleading. 

**Could you say more about that?**<br>
Well, it says would you like to request an informal conference? Yes, call me. Would you like a call to schedule an information conference? I think you’re leaving out the true intent. There has to be 1-2 days.. it’s just a time period on any given day. 

**Any other comments about this page?**<br>
No, I think that’s.. it.

**Please continue.**<br>

### 8th screen: Confirmation (submission) screen

**What do you see on this page?**<br>
Alright, so, I submitted this. I’m gonna get a letter, boom. After you request a decision review. That term hasn’t been used at all in this form. That’s a new term that pops out. What’s not included in this, what happens next… if I requested an informal conference I don’t see that there. If I requested one something should happen. After your higher-level review is complete you’ll get the information… I think you just gotta… you have to add that to this list. 

**Any other things you feel is missing on this page? or is unclear?**<br>
Again, the very last sentence, “You requested a decision review” you requested a higher-level review. You gotta use the same terms. 

**What do you expect to see if you click on status of claim or appeal?**<br>
It should say “track status of higher-level review”. I would expect higher-level review received.. in work.. I mean up front you told the veteran you’ll get a decision within 125 days so I think the most important one initially is that it was received although I think you’ll get an email confirming that. I’m not sure you want to tell someone it’s in the queue or not. Or make an entry when it is being processed. I don’t know what the necessary steps are that the VA wants to tell the veteran so. 

**Any other last comments about this page?**<br>
No.


### Post-Task Interview

**Overall what do you think about the online process of requesting a Higher Level Review?**<br>
It looked like it was pretty simple to request one overall. Everything was straightforward, glad to see that. The one thing I’m wondering is, again, maybe it wasn’t the intent but when. I look at the example with the Latin I gotta believe you gotta be able to input documents as well. 

**What do you think was most confusing in this process/flow?**<br>
I misinterpreted because I expected something else was requesting a call to schedule an informal review. I don’t think you need the intermediate call. It confused me. As you mentioned it to me I reread it and that’s exactly what it says to do but even then it’s a little lacking in that VA is asking for a two hour block any day of the week that isn’t gonna work. 

**What do you think was most helpful during this process?**<br>
I think the most helpful was.. it was pretty straightforward. The pre-populating of the conditions was very helpful. As long as everything is in the system and pops up, it simplifies the process. 

**Having tried to go through this, what do you think could be helpful for users to add to these pages? Either information or features.**<br>
Well, I think you should again take out that one paragraph that talked about, “well if you got to this point and you wanna submit for compensation or pension” that needs to be identified before you start this application. 

**Move that further along in the process?**<br>
Yes

**Do you have any other feedback to share with us today?**<br>
It’s really pretty simplified which is great!
