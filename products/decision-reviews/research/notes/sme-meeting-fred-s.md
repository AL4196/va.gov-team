## Decision Review - SME Meeting with Fred S.

#### What are the implications of the Feb 19, 2020 date? Specifically, what does it mean for the legacy appeals process?

- The actual appeals process changed on Feb 2019 - Feb 19, 2020 means the hard stop for legacy appeals

- Everybody will therefore only be able to file AMA

#### If I have a claims decision received before Feb 19, 2019, what happens to that?

- Both HLR and NOD have a year deadline from SOC - Form 0995 (Supplemental Claim) is not within year deadline

### If I have a legacy appeal decision received before Feb 19, 2019, what happens to that or anything else in the legacy system?

- Feb 18, 2019 wait till last minute to appeal, Feb 15, 2020 - still legacy appeal

- 60 days to opt in after SOC - 4 months of Feb 2020 date

- Remands are another consideration for keeping legacy info on website

### What are the plans for legacy appeals content on the website vs. new, AMA Decision-Review content?

- Essentially to wait till that Feb 2020 date and ‘flip the switch’ for AMA content being front and center as opposed to legacy
	

### Is AMA as a whole intended to be for pension and compensation claims only? Or does it also cover education claims and various other claims?

- It is intended to serve all types of claims, and currently does
