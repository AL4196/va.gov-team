## Decision Reviews: Va.gov Website Analytics

_Data gathered from Nov.6 - Dec 5, 2019_


### Pageviews

To get a holistic view of the new AMA content that is being consumed, we first took a look at the /decision-reviews path of the website, which contains the largest section of AMA appeals content.

- Decision Reviews section of the website received about 47,000 views in a given month.

- The supplemental claim subsection received the most views of all the ‘lanes’ - close to 30%.

- Higher Level Review and Board Appeal were a distant second and third, with about 8.5% and 6%, respectively.

- The root decision-reviews page received 21,540 views. Unsurprisingly, this was the most visited page as it serves as the ‘landing page’ for the decision review information on the website.

- Compared to the va.gov/disability/file-an-appeal landing page’s views  (that owns both AMA and legacy appeals content) at around 25,000, this is a fairly even spread of traffic for the two processes that exist for appeals.

### Takeaways


- **Pageviews** - There is almost the same amount of traffic for the /decision-reviews/ landing page as there is for the /disability/file-an-appeal landing page.

- **Pageviews** - The most viewed section of /decision-reviews/ is Supplemental Claims - this is in line with other metrics we have of it being the most ‘popular’ AMA lane.

- **Behavior** - A considerable amount of users come from the /file-an-appeal/ page to the /decision-reviews/ page and then exit back to the /file-an-appeal/ page, which may be an indication of confusion.

- **Search Terms** - Search terms containing the word ‘appeal’ were overall quite low and represented only about 0.5% of all search terms in the given time frame.

- **Events** - Users are downloading both AMA and legacy appeals forms. However, the way they access those forms are quite different, as 80% of users who download the legacy 0958 form do so from the /file-an-appeal/ page, while most users who download the AMA forms are doing so via a site search.
