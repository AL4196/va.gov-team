### Description 

This page gives users step-by-step information on how to apply for a caregiver benefit. It also sets clear expectations on when they can expect a decision on their application. This page also gives users ways to get help, as well as important information about that specific form or benefit.  

Users can navigate to a form’s introduction page either from within VA.gov or through an online search. Since users can navigate to this page from outside VA.gov, this page includes some basic benefit eligibility information and a link back to the VA.gov eligibility page.

## Subway map (required)

https://design.va.gov/components/process-list

Subway, or process, map shows the steps applicants need to take to apply for a benefit. The heading are action words and short/concise. We’ve made these consistent across forms. 

**Prepare**

Gives the applicant the information they’ll need to fill out the form, such as if they need to submit any document, SSN, bank information, military history, spouse information, etc.  This bullet can also include some basic eligibility information or a link back to the VA.gov benefit eligibility page.

Items that are optional are called out.<br>

**To fill out this application, you’ll need your:**

* [example] Your Social Security number 
* [example] copy of DD214
* 
{optional}
**[If you have a conditional situation] You may also need:**
- Loreum upsem
- Loreum upsem


**Apply**

We use the same language for this step across all forms: 

Complete this [benefits] form. After submitting the form, you’ll get a confirmation message. You can print this page for your records.
Within this header we include content about how an applicant can get help filling out the form.

This message is consistent across all forms: 

**What if I need help filling out my application?** 
An accredited representative, like a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) can [help you fill out your claim](https://www.va.gov/disability/get-help-filing-claim/).

**VA review**

The step tells applicants how much time it takes VA to review their application.  The content under this heading depends on what type of benefit an applicant is applying for.

Some examples: 

{for Health Care} *We process health care claims within a week.*

{for Education} *We usually process claims within 30 days. We’ll let you know by mail if we need more information.*

{for Disability} *We process applications in the order we receive them. We may contact you if we have questions or need more information.  The amount of time it takes to review your claim depends on:*
- Loreum upsem
- Loreum upsem
- Loreum upsem

**Decision**
This step tells applicants they will be informed about the status of their application (if denied or approved) and the next steps.
It also sets the user’s expectation for how long it takes to receive a response.
