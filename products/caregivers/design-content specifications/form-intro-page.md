### Description 

This page gives users step-by-step information on how to apply for a caregiver benefit. It also sets clear expectations on when they can expect a decision on their application. This page also gives users ways to get help, as well as important information about that specific form or benefit.  

Users can navigate to a form’s introduction page either from within VA.gov or through an online search. Since users can navigate to this page from outside VA.gov, this page includes some basic benefit eligibility information and a link back to the VA.gov eligibility page.
