## Research Goals 

The VA’s Caregiver program enables caregivers and Veterans to receive benefits from the VA. To date, the Caregiver program has focused on post-911 Veterans. The Mission Act calls for the expansion of this program to all eras of Veterans and an IT system to be built in order to support the expansion of the program.

The internal system (CARMA) requires the manual input of paper applications (form 1010-CG). When the Caregiver program expands, the paper process will not scale.
The Caregiver team is developing an MVP to move the 1010-CG online. We tested initial designs to make sure we're on the right track prior to pushing to production.

The goals of this usability study were to:
- Determine whether or not our MVP prototype of the 10-10CG form is usable and easy to navigate for Veterans and caregivers
- Determine whether the caregiver/Veteran have a clear/realistic understanding of requirements and expectations once form is submitted (next steps).

The research questions we wanted to address were:

- Where is the best place to have this form in the IA? Where would users want to find it?
- Are users able to navigate through the form easily and without hiccups?
- Is information displayed in a clear and understandable manner (text/components)?
- Do users understand how to fill in each field?
- Do users have a sense of where they are in the site and within user path?
- Do applicants understand requirements and are next steps transparent?
- What do users think will happen after they’ve submitted the form?
- What do users want to happen after submitting the form?

Prior to the study, we hypothesized that users will be able to navigate through the form relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:
- Clearly understanding when they’re entering veteran information versus caregiver information
- Understanding whether or not the caregiver actually qualifies for this benefit
- Understanding what a secondary caregiver is, and if they should care about that
 
## Research Methodology 

A task-based usability study was conducted remotely with Zoom between January 16 - January 21, 2020. 
A remote moderator began with introduction questions and prompt users with guiding questions (from the conversation guide). Participants were encouraged to talk through their exploration of the InVision prototype. Remote observers and note takers were also in attendance. 

The research assessed the forms ability to support users on three main tasks: 
1. Determining preferred location for Caregiver application in regards to IA
2. Would the participant know the eligibility requirements and other thoughts on the introduction page? 
3. Ability of a user to fill out the form smoothly and without hiccups. 


### Who we talked to

- 7 Caregivers
- 2 Veterans
- Geographically diverse (IN, GA, FL, TX, WI, VA, OH)
- Ages of our participants ranged from 25 to 74 
  - 2 participants under 35
  - 2  participants 35 - 44
  - 2 participants 45 - 54
  - 2  participants 55 - 64
  - 1  participant over 65


### Research Questions

- Where is the best place to have this form in the IA? 
- Where would users want to find it?
- Are users able to navigate through the form easily and without hiccups?
- Is information displayed in a clear and understandable manner (text/components)?
- Do users understand how to fill in each field?
- Do users have a sense of where they are in the site and within user path?
- Do applicants understand requirements and are next steps transparent?
- What do users think will happen after they’ve submitted the form?
- What do users want to happen after submitting the form?


## Key Findings
1. 6 out of the 9 participants managed to navigate to a caregiver landing page, using either the search box, the VA benefits and health care dropdown, or the family member benefits link. 

2. Participants were able to navigate the online form easily, understood the user path, and understood how to fill out most fields.

3. Participants had questions around the secondary caregiver definitions and requirements.

4. The “name of medical center” field caused difficulty for some users. 

5. A few participants expressed hesitation entering social security numbers for the Veteran and caregiver.

6. Users said they understood the requirements after reading the form, but with further questioning there were still questions surrounding eligibility requirements and next steps in the process.

7. For the most part, Caregivers filled out the form and would not ask their Veteran to fill out the Veteran portion of the form.

8. Most participants preferred the online form. 

9. Some users noted positive features of the paper form.

## Details of Findings
1. 6 out of the 9 participants managed to navigate to a caregiver landing page, using either the search box, the VA benefits and health care dropdown, or the family member benefits link. A few users were not able to locate without prompting from moderator and were stuck on the cards/blue background on va.gov. One user stated, “I'm going to go into the search box and I'm typing ‘caregiver program.’ Oh, I got it right away.”

2. Participants were able to navigate the online form easily, understood the user path, and understood how to fill out most fields. The form was logical for users and they were familiar with the overall flow of the form. One participant stated, 
“It looks nicely set up...I really liked the form...I feel like it’s much faster when you do it online. I like that you can print out the confirmation at the end. There wasn’t really anything confusing on there for me.” Another user added, “Well, I’ll just add that the form for the caregivers was excellent...that one was. I’m an American Legion commander so I’ll pass it on to my post.” 

3. Participants did have questions around the secondary caregiver definitions and requirements. Many participants were confused by this section. Participants were uncertain who was, and was not, a secondary caregiver (who qualified) as many users had individuals supporting them. Questions around, “is it someone else who also is taking care of the vet, but not as much as me?” surfaced. One participant said, “ We have four children in the home and my mother lives with us to take care of the children because i take care of my husband. I know I’m the primary caregiver but would my grandmother be a secondary caregiver? I would need to go revisit this secondary caregiver.” 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will appear with six space characters in front of it A couple participants were confused if they were “supposed” to enter a secondary caregiver and if it was required. This : : caused a roadblock in form completion. One user said, "Oh, this part is required, to add a secondary?"

One participant, who attempted to add a secondary caregiver during the study would not know the secondary caregiver’s social security number, and was uncertain how they would get the secondary caregiver’s signature (as they don’t live together). The user would not feel comfortable signing for the secondary caregiver. This would add complication into the process of adding a secondary caregiver and completing form. 

4. The “name of medical center” field did cause difficulty for some users. A participant stated when referring to the Veteran’s medical center, “There are a couple different ones because he goes where the primary doctor is, and the medicine doctor are in different locations.” Another user stated, “My husband receives care at multiple VA clinics…” 

5. A few participants expressed hesitation to enter social security numbers of the Veteran and caregiver. A user stated, “I always get nervous when I put in Social Security number, even on a government form…” Another participant expressed, “Not everyone is comfortable sharing everything online and maybe they are more hesitant.” 

6. Users said they understood the requirements after reading the form, but with further questioning there were still questions surrounding eligibility requirements and next steps in the process. Most notably, being unsure if mental or emotional (e.g. PTSD)  issues qualified for the Caregiver program. One user said when discussing eligibility, “I think from what I've heard...a lot of people have been denied. It seems like it has to be physical. It has to be like your husband physically can't, or your Veteran can’t, you know, tie their shoes, or they can't drive, or they can't bathe themselves. With my husband, it’s like all, it’s severe PTSD.” 

Other issues around requirements centered on caregiver’s requirements. One participant stated, “My question would be what are the program requirements...because I'm getting homemaker services from the VA, would they take those away because I'm doing this?” 

Users expressed desire for Veteran and caregiver eligibility (in plain language) all in one place because it was not always clear enough on the electronic form. One user stated, “No, I wouldn’t know right off I was eligible just by looking at that.” 

7. For the most part, Caregivers filled out the form and would not ask the Veteran to fill out the Veteran portion of the form. Intersetly, the majority of caregivers said they would have no problem filling out both boxes (veteran and caregiver) on the signature page. However, all caregivers said they would let the Veteran know what program they were applying for or talk to the Veteran at the time of consent. One participant expressed, “In full honesty I would never do anything behind my husband's back with his care, but I would probably just tell him, ‘Hey, I'm filling this out and I need to type your name. You need a caregiver and I've entered the proper information.’ And then I would type his name for him.” Another user said, “...so at this point I would go in and tell my husband I’m doing this and ask for his consent. And he would tell me I don’t need to read it to him and I would fill it out and submit.” 

8. Most participants preferred the online form. However, some users noted positive features from the paper form. 

Users preferred the online form for these reasons: 

- Many users noted the positives to being able to save information if they were distracted or did not know certain information. One participant said, “I would sign in because I would want to know I can save and come back to it in case I have questions or something.”  

- Confirmation and proof that form was submitted. Another user stated, “I think electronic transmission, getting to the VA in that way, there was a little bit of a paper trail in the electronic one, anyway, where I could go back and prove that I submitted something. That seems to be a challenge at the VA, they tend to lose things and it's on you to prove that they sent it. So, I like to see online portals kind of take that out of your hand and create that right away for you. And I think my generation loves to do everything online. I don't have to talk to anyone, I can just fill this out, great."

- The ability to auto-populate fields made the form less tedious. Seemed simple or less intimidating (one participant thought there were literally fewer fields). Convenience of online submission (some participants did not enjoy buying envelopes, mailing, or the faxing process).

9. Some users noted the positives of the paper form. The “Who should apply” boxes made sense to participants, easier for Veterans who had trouble parsing information (caregivers are the ones mostly filling in the form, and they preferred online). There was a split on whether or not it was useful or too wordy to have all the definitions up front, as it is on the paper form. One user said,  “I think something that was most beneficial to me was where it said ‘Do you do this, do you do this, do you do this? Okay, if you said yes to any of these then you are a Caregiver.’" 

## Additional Insights
- A few caregivers would enter their phone number and email in the Veteran information section. Noting the Veteran will not answer their phone. 

- Most participants attempted to sign in to start the Caregiver application noting the desire to save information so that if they were distracted they could come back to the form.

- One participant was confused by the The Stepper / Progress Bar not changing when clicking continue (was under the impression they actually navigated backwards). However, one participant found the stepper helpful. 

- Not many participants clicked on Additional Info sections. It is unclear if it’s because it was a contrived scenario as most people stated they had indeed seen them when prompted. Many users, when asked how they’d get additional info, said they’d go on online community (i.e. Facebook) or do a Google search. 

- Participants understood the Signature Boxes at the end of the form. Many wanted to review the application, and seemed to understand the “accordion” interaction and were comfortable clicking the box and entering in the names of the Veteran and caregiver (see 7 under Key Findings). 


**Results of hypotheses**

Users will be able to navigate through the form relatively easily, but may have issues with the following clearly understanding when they’re entering veteran information versus caregiver information. 

People understood this w/out an issue.

Understanding whether or not the caregiver actually qualifies for this benefit
Was this true? 

Yes, there were some issues with this (see in #4 in the above section.

Understanding what a secondary caregiver is, and if they should care about that
Was this true?

Yes.  This was a concern that we address in the #3 in the above section.
