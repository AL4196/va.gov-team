## Research Goals 

The VA’s Caregiver program enables caregivers and Veterans to receive benefits from the VA. To date, the Caregiver program has focused on post-911 Veterans. The Mission Act calls for the expansion of this program to all eras of Veterans and an IT system to be built in order to support the expansion of the program.

The internal system (CARMA) requires the manual input of paper applications (form 1010-CG). When the Caregiver program expands, the paper process will not scale.
The Caregiver team is developing an MVP to move the 1010-CG online. We tested initial designs to make sure we're on the right track prior to pushing to production.

The goals of this usability study were to:
Determine whether or not our MVP prototype of the 10-10CG form is usable and easy to navigate for Veterans and caregivers
Determine whether the caregiver/Veteran have a clear/realistic understanding of requirements and expectations once form is submitted (next steps).
The research questions we wanted to address were:
Where is the best place to have this form in the IA? Where would users want to find it?
Are users able to navigate through the form easily and without hiccups?
Is information displayed in a clear and understandable manner (text/components)?
Do users understand how to fill in each field?
Do users have a sense of where they are in the site and within user path?
Do applicants understand requirements and are next steps transparent?
What do users think will happen after they’ve submitted the form?
What do users want to happen after submitting the form?
