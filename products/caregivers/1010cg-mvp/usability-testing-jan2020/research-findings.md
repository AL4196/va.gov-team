## Research Goals 

The VA’s Caregiver program enables caregivers and Veterans to receive benefits from the VA. To date, the Caregiver program has focused on post-911 Veterans. The Mission Act calls for the expansion of this program to all eras of Veterans and an IT system to be built in order to support the expansion of the program.

The internal system (CARMA) requires the manual input of paper applications (form 1010-CG). When the Caregiver program expands, the paper process will not scale.
The Caregiver team is developing an MVP to move the 1010-CG online. We tested initial designs to make sure we're on the right track prior to pushing to production.

The goals of this usability study were to:
- Determine whether or not our MVP prototype of the 10-10CG form is usable and easy to navigate for Veterans and caregivers
- Determine whether the caregiver/Veteran have a clear/realistic understanding of requirements and expectations once form is submitted (next steps).

The research questions we wanted to address were:

- Where is the best place to have this form in the IA? Where would users want to find it?
- Are users able to navigate through the form easily and without hiccups?
- Is information displayed in a clear and understandable manner (text/components)?
- Do users understand how to fill in each field?
- Do users have a sense of where they are in the site and within user path?
- Do applicants understand requirements and are next steps transparent?
- What do users think will happen after they’ve submitted the form?
- What do users want to happen after submitting the form?

Prior to the study, we hypothesized that users will be able to navigate through the form relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:
- Clearly understanding when they’re entering veteran information versus caregiver information
- Understanding whether or not the caregiver actually qualifies for this benefit
- Understanding what a secondary caregiver is, and if they should care about that
 
## Research Methodology 

A task-based usability study was conducted remotely with Zoom between January 16 - January 21, 2020. 
A remote moderator began with introduction questions and prompt users with guiding questions (from the conversation guide). Participants were encouraged to talk through their exploration of the InVision prototype. Remote observers and note takers were also in attendance. 

The research assessed the forms ability to support users on three main tasks: 
1. Determining preferred location for Caregiver application in regards to IA
2. Would the participant know the eligibility requirements and other thoughts on the introduction page? 
3. Ability of a user to fill out the form smoothly and without hiccups. 


### Who we talked to

- 7 Caregivers
- 2 Veterans
- Geographically diverse (IN, GA, FL, TX, WI, VA, OH)
- Ages of our participants ranged from 25 to 74 
  - 2 participants under 35
  - 2  participants 35 - 44
  - 2 participants 45 - 54
  - 2  participants 55 - 64
  - 1  participant over 65


### Research Questions

- Where is the best place to have this form in the IA? 
- Where would users want to find it?
- Are users able to navigate through the form easily and without hiccups?
- Is information displayed in a clear and understandable manner (text/components)?
- Do users understand how to fill in each field?
- Do users have a sense of where they are in the site and within user path?
- Do applicants understand requirements and are next steps transparent?
- What do users think will happen after they’ve submitted the form?
- What do users want to happen after submitting the form?


## Key Findings
1. 6 out of the 9 participants managed to navigate to a caregiver landing page, using either the search box, the VA benefits and health care dropdown, or the family member benefits link. 

2. Participants were able to navigate the online form easily, understood the user path, and understood how to fill out most fields.

3. Participants had questions around the secondary caregiver definitions and requirements.

4. The “name of medical center” field caused difficulty for some users. 

5. A few participants expressed hesitation entering social security numbers for the Veteran and caregiver.

6. Users said they understood the requirements after reading the form, but with further questioning there were still questions surrounding eligibility requirements and next steps in the process.

7. For the most part, Caregivers filled out the form and would not ask their Veteran to fill out the Veteran portion of the form.

8. Most participants preferred the online form. 

9. Some users noted positive features of the paper form.
