## Overview [WIP]

During the research phase of the caregiver project we need to answer a few key questions from a front-end standpoint -

1. How do we currently collect signatures on forms for va.gov and what will that mean for our form?
2. What is involved in interfacing with the CARMA system?
3. What is the scope involved with creating a form on va.gov?
4. How does the 'save in progress' feature for forms on va.gov work from a technical standpoint?
5. What would be the scope of going past a form in functionality into a full "dashboard" experience for caregivers?

In our research we have found the answers to these questions to be as follows -

### How do we currently collect signatures on forms for va.gov and what will that mean for our form?

We looked at several forms that currently exist on va.gov as well as met with folks that had worked on previous form projects for the site and found a few critical insignts -

* The current forms on va.gov use a simple checkbox to serve as a "signature" by proxy, this is not a physical signature per se but serves the same purpose of a signature style confirmation from the user
* The form 10-10CG that we are modernizing comes with a 90 review process where the caregiver(s) must be interviewed, background checked, and verified. This means that the collection of a physical signature is not nearly as important if this review process was not in place.
