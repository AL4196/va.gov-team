To identify possible pitfalls or opportunities with the caregiver project, as well as to properly scope out the project, we
need to answer some questions about the environemnt this project will live in. As it pertains to the front-end this step
is critical in figuring out the level of effort/ time needed to reuse or create new front-end components.


## What is the technical environment for the new online caregiver experience?

1. Will this live in a React environemnt?

2. Will this use Drupal?

- I have seen that there are Drupal related files in the vets.gov website repo, will we be building this in that area?

3. Will this need to interface with any internal/ external APIs other than the CARMA system?
