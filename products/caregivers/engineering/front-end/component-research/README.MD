In order to stick with best practices we need to be sure that we are not duplicating work that can already been done
elsewhere in the codebase. If there are reusable front-end components then we want to use those if possible. Likewise if
this project requires a component that truely does not fit with what has been built already then we need to scope out
that new component.

## What new components, if any, will need to be created for the new online experience?
