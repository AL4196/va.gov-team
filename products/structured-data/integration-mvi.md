# MVI
aka "Master Person Index". MVI is a database that holds over 17 million unique patient identity entries, populated from all VA facilities nationwide. The MVI matches/links system records together across the VA systems. The MVI also establishes a unique enterprise identifier for each of the VA unique person records; the identifier is called an Integration Control Number (ICN). MVI uses SOAP for exchanging structured data with other services. MVI uses 'correlation ids' as a foreign key to reference external services.
