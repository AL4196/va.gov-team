Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Backlog pipeline, it must have the following:

Workflow + Cadence
Our project cadence will be determined by our release plan (rather than sprints) since we will be releasing on a frequent basis. There will be four release cycles with intermittent PRs throughout.

Stand-up: Check in on people and product progress
Mon + Weds @ 2:30 PM EST
30 min
Monday - draft and review the Team of Team Slides + regular updates
Wednesday - debrief any pertinent Team of Teams info + regular updates
Release Planning: Outline work to be done this release in order to accomplish the team's goals
1st Tuesday of every release
1 hour
Grooming: Review and adjust planned stories
1 Friday of every release
45 min

Communication
Slack:
#va-startup-pension-automation: Should only be used for sensitive internal communications
#vfs-pension-automation: Should be used for day-to-day discussions about project work
#vfs-platform-support: For any issues or questions

Meetings:

Team Norms
