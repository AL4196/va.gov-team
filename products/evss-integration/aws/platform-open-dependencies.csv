Without that EPB-4853 Capability: Implement Transitive Trust Relationship with Vets.gov for Identity will not be able to be groomed.,7/19/17 17:10PRG-1000,124302,"(Platform) If a decision is not made as to which service(s) to move first to the Ascent Platform, then cooresponding supporting platform capailibites may not be available to support whatever is ultimately decided is the highest priority.","A decision is needed as to what services will go first to the Ascent platform.  That will drive what platform capabilities/EPBs are needed to support them.  For example, it is assumed that Claims/Doc will go first and the following EPBs were created to support them:EPB-4894	Capability: Distributed CacheEPB-4896	Capability: Implement Messaging InfrastructureHowever, if these are not the first services being migrated then it may be that these EPBs should not be done first, and time and resources used to start on these EPBs may be wasted.

If not, deployment will be delayed.  In addition, if any associated concern would impact the platform architecture, design, or development, then identifying that late in the development cycle could impact development of the platform and/or the associated services.",7/24/17 15:43PRG-1003,124551,"(Platform) If a connection to the VA backend is not made available to the AWS infrastructure, the Ascent Platform and the associated services to support vets.gov will not be able to be deployed to production.","A connection with sufficient performance to enable the components of the Ascent Platform installed on the AWS infrastructure to communicate with the backend services at the VA is required.  Without it, services will not work in production.",7/24/17 15:52PRG-1004,124555,"(Platform) If ownership of the maintenance responsibility for the new servers is not in place before deployments are ready, the Ascent Platform and associated services to support vets.gov will not be able to be deployed to production.","The new servers will need to be maintained and whoever is going to be responsible for that needs to be defined and able to maintain them as a prerequisite for the Ascent Platform to be deployed to production.",7/24/17 16:01PRG-1005,124556,"(Platform) If an appropriate security assessment covering the VA AWS infrastructure is not in place, the Ascent Platform and the associated services to support vets.gov will not be able to be fully developed and deployed to production.","For example, is the DHS Gov Cloud security assessment adequate or does VA need its own policy?  Having approval from a security standpoint is a prerequisite for the Ascent Platform to be deployed to production and that needs to be in place prior to deployment.  If not, deployment will be delayed.  In addition, if any security concern would impact the platform architecture, design, or development, then identifying that late in the development cycle could impact development of the platform and/or the associated services.",7/24/17 16:08PRG-1006,124557,"(Platform) If TRM updates needed by the Ascent Platform are not approved before development completes and deployments are ready, the Ascent Platform and associated services to support vets.gov will not be able to be deployed to production.","Having approval from a TRM standpoint is a prerequisite for the Ascent Platform to be deployed to production and that needs to be in place prior to deployment.

However, they are not sufficient to support the expected load when the Ascent Platform and associated services are deployed to production.  Agreements will need to be in place that will scale to the expected production load.",7/24/17 16:17PRG-1012,126252,(Platform) If outbound access to the public internet is not provided to some of our EC2 instances the deployment pipeline will not be able to be created.,"Some of our EC2 instances hosted within the private subnet need to have outbound access to the public internet:1. Our Nexus server needs the ability to connect to public artifact repositories in order to download libraries needed to build our applications.2. Our Consul cluster needs to be able to make API calls to the AWS API in order to dynamically identify other members of the cluster as it scales up/down.3. Our Jenkins build server will need access to GitHub in order to clone source code repositories.Implementation of our deployment pipeline will be blocked without these things.  Our understanding that to get to the internet requires routing through the Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) before hitting the public internet. That is managed by the VA Network and Security Operations Center (NSOC).  A prerequisite to routing through the TIC is a connection to the VA back end (PRG-1003).  This ticket is to cover what is needed to get public internet access to the appropriate EC2 instances once the back end connection is made available.  That is, to work with the NSOC to get appropriate routing and access to the public internet through the TIC or through some other workaround if that is possible.",8/28/17 14:04
