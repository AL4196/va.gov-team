LOEs from Josh L (from back in July 2016)

EVSS used a tech complexity scale of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.  The first number represents the complexity to provide a more rohbust API based model, the second is a green field estimate.  Where we have an N/A is where eben current doesn’t have this functionality we cannot really comment on the ability to “transform it” without more research.
