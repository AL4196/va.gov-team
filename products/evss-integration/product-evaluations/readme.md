# eBenefits Basic Product Evaluations

## About

The goal of this project is to better understand what the online tool is and estimate how much design work will be needed if/when we move this tool to vets.gov. 

## Tool

- [Adding Dependents to Your VA Benefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/about/feature?feature=dependent-compensation) (2 forms: 686c/674)

## Methods

__Heuristic Review__

The heuristic review will provide gaps in the design based on checklist of accepted usability principles. This information might be redundant to what we learn from stakeholders and data mining. If necessary, a light heuristic review could supplement what we learn though. Heuristic evaluation is not a substitute for usability tests.

|Week|Deliverable|Description|

|2|Heuristic Assessments|Personal assessment of usability, efficiency, and effectiveness of the interfaces.|

__Opportunities__

- This will also help us identify areas to focus on during usability testing. 
- It will give us feedback in a less resource intensive way

__Risks__

- Typically multiple usabilty experts review to offset designer bias
- It will best identify minor areas of focus and will not identify major issues or could mislead on major issues
