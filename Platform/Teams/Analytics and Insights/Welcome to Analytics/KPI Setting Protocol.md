# KPI Setting Protocol

**Goal**: All VFS teams will have Key Performance Indicators set up, be supported in tracking their data, and use these metrics for data-driven product decisions and goals. 

## KPI Setting Workshops (_During Team Onboarding_)
1. Analytics and Insights (Insights) will set up 2 hour workshops with VFS, VSP, and VFS teams. Insights will provide an editable copy of the [KPI Setting Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGN2TKNwmobdl4yhxjyd_bua22KUkW3K56RU7yHMNrk/edit#gid=221438008) to each team before the workshop for teams to meet internally and fill out the pre-work areas of the template.
2. During the workshop, teams will use the provided Google Doc to dynamically fill out their KPIs. Insights will lead and support the workshop.
3. Post-workshop, teams will download an Excel version of their Google Doc and upload the Excel version to their team Github folder.

## Ongoing KPI Setting (_Post Team Onboarding_)
1. Insights will incorporate results from KPI workshops and check-ins to the Product Health Tool.
2. Insights will perform quarterly KPI check-ins with each team. 
    - These check-ins will incorporate the KPI results, resulting actions, and any adjustments to KPIs.
3. Insights will be readily available for team questions and updates on KPIs and product health metrics.
