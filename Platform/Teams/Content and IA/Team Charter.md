# VSP Content & IA Team Charter

## Mission:
Uphold usability and plain language standards across Content and Navigation on VA.gov, and empower VFS Teams with the guidance, documentation, and reviews necessary for them to create content and IA in line with those standards.

## Responsibilities:
- Meet regularly w/VFS teams to discuss in-progress content and IA and provide guidance
- Be available in #vfs-platform-support to answer Content and IA related questions
- Provide plain language content reviews for VFS Teams
- Provide IA reviews for VFS Teams

## Still TBD:
- What about VA.gov Content Owners? Who takes care of requests they submit? And do those updates need to be reviewed/approved by VSP?
- What about this ongoing review work we're doing for CMS right now? Is that supposed to be on our team, or on a VFS team?

## How VSP Content & IA team collaborates with VFS Content & IA Team Members:
- VFS Teams will write their own content, following the guidance and standards provided by VSP
- VFS Teams will meet regularly with the VSP Content & IA Team to provide updates on their content and IA thoughts/approaches in order to stay on track and schedule reviews appropriately.
- VFS Teams will update their content per the recommendations from VSP reviews
- There shouldn't be any VFS Teams onboarded onto VSP if they don't have a content person on their team. DSVA should take care of this through Intake.
