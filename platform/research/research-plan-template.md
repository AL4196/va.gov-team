# Research Plan for [Team, Product, Date]
This is a research plan for usability testing of the HLR (High Level Review) process, January 2020. By Kevin Stachura and Christian Valla.

## Goals
1. Benefits and memorial. HLR process. 
2. Background: The HLR process has been tested before, but changes have been made after the testing, thus another round of usability testing is needed. In addition, the HLR process as a product has changed hands several times during the last few months, so this product needs a new "research ownership". Christian Valla and Kevin Stachura will collaborate as researchers on this product. 
A number of pages have been created by designers. The usability testig will check for usability issues, pain points, and any confusing steps, missing info or confusing or unclear language. 
3. Research questions: Are there any usbability issues within the HLR pages? Are there any pain points? Are there any confusing steps, info or language? Are ll links active and correct? 
4. Hypothesis: We believe that most steps within the HLR process is self explanatory and simple. We will test this hypothesis. 

## Method
1.	Usability testing with 8-10 Veterans remotely. Strive towards a spread among age, location, experience with VA, experience with VA websites, and overall "tech savvyness". The veteran need to be able to use Zoom or Hangout and share his / her screen, and to engage with an online, high fideleity prototype. 
This will be task-oriented, semi-structured usability testing, with high-fidelity prototypes (ready).
This will be remotely moderated interviews.
The users will be veterans that have an active standing in VA, and are elligible for a HLR (double check this..) 
  
2.	The task-oriented usability tests will allow us to observe the users engaging and using the prototype. Wwill observe whether the users are able to completed the specific tasks successfully or not. We will observe their process, the time they use and any pain points and confusion. We will ask probing questions along the way.

3.	This usability test will be executed Remotely, using Zoom or Google hangout. The veteran needs to be able to use Zoom or Google hangout, to share screen and engage / use / solve tasks using a high fidelity prototype.  

4.  We will be testing a high fidelity prototype / pages of the HLR process. (Link here...)

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria:  8-10 veterans, good spread geograpically, gender and age. 
The veterans must be able to log into and work with an online, high fidelity prototype of the HLR process, they must be able to install and use Zoom or Google Hangouts, and be able and willing to share their screen as they are using the prototype. 
They need to be outspoken about their user experiences, and be able to describe to the researcher what they are doing, thinking, trying to accomplish at every step, when using the prototype.  

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact UX lead.)

## When? 
1.	Timeline: mid january to end of january 2020
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote)

2.	Prepare: the prototypes are ready for testing.  

3.  Length of Sessions: 1 hour.

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 

## Team Roles
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 
- Moderator:
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):
- Participant recruiting & screening:
- Project point of contact:
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Note-takers:
- Observers:

**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**
