# Research Plan for [Team, Product, Date]
This is a research plan for usability testing of the HLR (High Level Review) process, January 2020. By Kevin Stachura and Christian Valla.

## Goals
1. Benefits and memorial. HLR process. 
2. Background: The HLR process has been tested before, but changes have been made after the usability testing, thus another round of usability testing is needed. Also the HLR process as a product has changed hands several times during the last few months, so this product needs an owner. Christian Valla will be the lead researcher on this product, Kevin Stachura will also be a researcher on this product.  A number of pages have been created by designers. The usability testig will check for usability issues, pain points, and any confusing steps or language. 
3. Research questions: Are there any usbability issues within the HLR pages? Are there any pain points? Are there any confusing steps, info or language? 
4. Hypothesis: We believe that most steps within the HLR process is self explanatory and simple. We will test this hypothesis. 

## Method
1.	Usability testing with Veterans remotely. 8-10 veteran users. Spread among age, sex, location, experience with VA. 
  This will be task-oriented, semi-structured usability testing, with high-fidelity prototypes.
  This will be remotely moderated interviews.
  
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*

4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact UX lead.)

## When? 
1.	Timeline: mid january to end of january 2020
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote)

2.	Prepare: the prototypes are ready for testing.  

3. Length of Sessions: 1 hour.

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 

## Team Roles
