### Meetings Notes and Background Info

**Kick-off - 3/19/2020**
- Previous work and research done last fall, those changes were implemented and made it to staging
- was supposed to go global, but then was backed off to just VAMC facility sites
- what is in staging now is not what they are going with, its not completely up to date with latest designs
- Won't be doing any additional usability testing, but will use that check-point to ensure all VSP areas are represented in review prior to going into build
