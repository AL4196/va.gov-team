# IA Review and Recommendations

**IA Review Issue:** 

### IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements. *

Upon review of the user research and their responses/actions to being asked where they would look for information on the caregiver program or stipend, 50% of the participants went to the "Family member benefits" hub via the link on the home page and 30% used search to ultimately find the existing PCAFC content page.  One individual used the top nav and went to the Family member benefits option under health care. 

Based on this information, and the fact that the current modernized VA.gov experience does not have Caregiver content on it.  My recommendation is place the application and the existing PCAFC content page under the Family member hub page.  Although this content area was not intended to include child pages, the PCAFC and its application are more broad than Health care or any other single benefit and fit better with the family member content.

Page 1: Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers 
- Primary entry points for this content page will remain the same as they are today, just links need to be updated to go to the correct URL
  - Health care hub - 


### Redirects/Canonical <br>
*Identify if any redirect or canonical tags are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  

For redirects, please submit a Redirect Request at least 2 weeks in advance per the [Redirect Request Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/request-redirect.md).


### Additional Notes/Recommendations
- Although this recommends shifting some content to live under the family member hub, other dependent/spouse/family/caregiver content is generally specific to a benefit (i.e. disability, health care, etc.) and therefore is not reocmmended to shift to the family member hub. This content is geared towards Caregivers, which is an audience that we do not currently have content for as well as covers multiple benefits and will be best served being separate from a specific benefits hub. 



**Early thoughts/recommendations**
- Couple with PCAFC page that currently lives within Health Care; considering this program goes beyond health care, should look at possibly moving page and form under family member hub.
