**IA Review Issue:** 

### IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements. *



### Navigation/Entry Points <br>
*The primary entry points and changes to global navigation, as well as any potential crosslinking opportunities*



### Redirects/Canonical <br>
*Identify if any redirect or canonical tags are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  


There are a few legacy pages that are duplicative to our current/future pages, wondering if you have discussed with your stakeholders to determine if we should be redirecting their old pages to our new ones at some point? It seems as though their main DLC page should link off to our pages rather than them maintaining the same information.

For redirects, please submit a Redirect Request at least 2 weeks in advance per the [Redirect Request Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/request-redirect.md).

### Meeting Notes

**4/1/2020 - Pre-usability Collab**
- Will the order history capability be part of this phase of work?
  - Not part of initial phase
  - Need to discuss how to approach IA with this still in mind or whether it is deferred for the longer term
  
 - Pre-usability feedback issue: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/6499
   - There is no IA feedback at this point, so an IA specific feedback issue was not created.
