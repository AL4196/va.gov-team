### Meeting notes


**Pre-usability Testing Collab**
- IA feedback documented: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/7140
- discussed the left nav and breadcrumb and need for individual pages for each nav item to support deep linking and improve navigation usability on mobile
- Connected apps - 3rd party app user experience does the informing and connecting, the profile just provides the ability to view what is connected and allow users to disconnect it
- 


**Early feedback provided on 1/28**
- From an IA perspective, there are no issues with the tabs vs a left nav design for navigating different sections of the profile.  If a tabbed version is used and there's a concern that the number of tabs may exceed the width of the screen, I would review how the content within profile is organzied and challenge design to reduce the number of sections/groupings. 
- A card sort activity could be helpful in determining the tabs/groups, what goes in them and labeling
- Be sure tab labels, although shortened, still have enough information scent for users to understand what they would find in the section
- Ensure we have the ability to link directly to profile with a specific tab defaulted to open (by way of parameters or separate URL) - i.e. a user may go from the unauthenticated static page for direct deposit and be dropped directly into that tab in the profile.  This experience should be tested as well to ensure its not disorienting to users and they understand where they were taken. 
- Breadcrumbs are currently based on page hierarchy, so unless you are going to a different page, the current page breadcrumb label does not change. In other words, the breadcrumb will always say "Home > Profile". If user testing shows users want to use the breadcrumb to navigate to the default Profile view, we can/should revisit this.
