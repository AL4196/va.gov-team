# IA Review and Recommendations

**Team:** eBenefits

**Product/Featue:** View Dependents

**Background/Context:**
- One of the most used features on EBN is View and Update Dependents. It is the only self-service place in the VA ecosystem that a Veteran can quickly view the dependents on their compensation award, as well as add, remove, or modify those dependents by electronically submitting the 686c. 
 - Initial functionality being built will be to view dependents only, with the intent that the ability to add and modify dependents will come later. 
 - There is no current plans for this capability to impact benefits beyond disability. 

**Review Date:** In Progress
