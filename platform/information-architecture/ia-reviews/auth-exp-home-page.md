### Meetings Notes and Background Info

**4/16/20 - Kick-off**
- when logged in you have the home page and the My VA Dashboard - they compete for attention with the Veteran
- Dashboard is supposed to be a personalized space with VA - many don't use or know about it
- Current dashboard is designed like a content page, doesn't utilize the design system
- User goals:
  - easy access to tools/tasks specific to my VA experience
  - easily see status updates and notifications
  - quickly complete tasks the user came to do and move on
- Biz goals: 
 - lay a foundation for a personalized home page that is relevant to the user type and their tasks
 - have a place to highlight status updates and notifications
 - retire My VA
- Future thoughts for authenticated tools navigation 
- Logged in home page vs profile?
- Timeline - launch before end of year would be awesome, doing discovery phase now, this will likely be broken down into a couple projects
