### IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements. *



### Navigation/Entry Points <br>
*The primary entry points and changes to global navigation, as well as any potential crosslinking opportunities*



### Redirects/Canonical <br>
*Identify if any redirect or canonical tags are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  

For redirects, please submit a Redirect Request at least 2 weeks in advance per the [Redirect Request Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/request-redirect.md).


### Additional Notes/Recommendations

**Early considerations/recommendations**
- review existing YR static pages, how will this tool link from static content and how do pages redirect (parameter based)
- content lives deep in education, content should be moved to more resources spoke
