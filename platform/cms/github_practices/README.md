## Issue labels 

We have about [50 pre-defined labels](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/labels) in the va.gov-cms repo, which should help us to:

* Develop and leadership and ownership over our various workstreams products, subsystems, and practice areas. 
* Groom backlog, prioritize epics and stories, and triage bugs by theme.
* Track progress towards objectives (eg how many enhancements delivered). 
* Help users of CMS managed products, and product design teams, collaborate on our backlog. 
* Align with certain practices already in use on VSP and VFS teams. 
* Discern bot-driven issues (dependabot, primarily) from human issues.

**Issue type (red):** Issue type is the first label that's added, and typically it's added automatically by which [issue template you choose](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/new/choose). (Each of these issues types have an [associated issue template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)). 

* Epics contain enhancements or tasks. 
* Enhancements issues may "contain" tasks.
* Defects issues stand alone.
* "CMS discovery request" and "Support or training request" will typically be created by members other product teams. 

**Issue status (light blue):** These labels (groomed or not groomed) will help us prepare for grooming. 

**Objectives (orange):** These labels will help us track progress towards our [program objectives](#) (link forthcoming!).
