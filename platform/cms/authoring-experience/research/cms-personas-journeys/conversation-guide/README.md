## [WIP] Journey Mapping - xx min

Now, I'll share my screen with you and we'll do an activity called journey mapping. _(confirm that participant can see your screen)_ A journey map is a series of steps that someone goes through to accomplish a goal. For example, buy a car, book a hotel. So, a journey map is composed of a series or actions in a timeline. Today, we're particularly interested in hearing about you experience with two journeys: VA.gov CMS Onboarding and Content Editing. 

In this activity, you'll walk us through the main steps that you take when going through a journey. I'll ask you to provide as much detail as you can in regards to your actions, thoughts, feelings in each step of the journey.

Let's start!
