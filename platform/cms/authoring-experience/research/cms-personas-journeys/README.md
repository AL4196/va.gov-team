# Research Plan for VFS-CMS tool, February 2020

## Goals
This research plan is for the VFS-CMS Tool - VFS-CMS team.

The VFS-CMS tool is VA.gov's content management system that provides the structured content templates, workflows and governance that help various teams at VA serve veterans accurate, accessible, up-to-date content.

Our objective for this research is to identify VFS-CMS user personas and understand their experience with the _content editing_ and _CMS onboarding_ journeys. 

#### Hypothesis: 
Our hypothesis is that we will be able to identify a first version of VFS-CMS user personas based on the way that they experience the the _content editing_ and _CMS onboarding_ journeys.

#### Personas key attributes
* Work priorities
* Main workflows
* Content authority
* Drupal CMS proficiency
* Frequency of Drupal CMS usage
* Drupal CMS vocabulary
* Support preferences

## Method	
In-person moderated interviews combined with journey mapping in one session will help us uncover first-hand stories that are specific to the relevant phases of the journeys, while gaining understanding of behavior patterns. We'll watch for emotions, mindsets, motivations, pain-points and needs. In case where in-person sessions are not possible, the sessions will be conducted via Zoom.

###### In-person sessions
* Conversation guide
* Post-its
* Zoom recording

###### Remote sessions
* Conversation guide
* Smaply journey template
* Zoom recording

Data management will follow the [VFS-CMS research procedures](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/authoring-experience/research/research-procedures) to protect PII.

## Participants and Recruitment	
Due to the a narrow user base for statistical-representative personas, three _user groups_ were selected in the editorial workflow spectrum based on editorial work commonalities. Research participants will be selected within each _user group_. We'll watch for behavioral patterns in each _user group_.

###### VSA Public Website Teams - 5 participants
* Constantly asking for features
* Experienced Drupal CMS users
* Have more governance needs
* Work with several stakeholders
* "Content-empowered" people
###### Web Manager and VAMC PAOs - 2 participants
* VAMC content editors
* People on the ground, handling content regarding life/death situations
* Work with decentralized content
* Are at the receiving end of design intentions
* We'll onboard new PAOs for VISN 4
###### Content Stakeholders - 4 participants
* Content reviewers
* Work with people who use the Drupal CMS tool
