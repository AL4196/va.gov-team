# Research Plan for VFS-CMS tool, February 2020

## Goals
This research plan is for the VFS-CMS Tool - VFS-CMS team.

The VFS-CMS tool is VA.gov's content management system that provides the structured content templates, workflows and governance that help various teams at VA serve veterans accurate, accessible, up-to-date content.

Our objective for this research is to evaluate the content review experience within the Drupal CMS. We'll focus on the experience of benefits detail page Editors. 
* Determine if users understand the content review process.
* Evaluate comprehension of navigation and on-page interactions on the content review screens.
* Verify if the text and labels used on the content review screens are clear and can guide users to a succesful content review.
* Uncover pain points, user expectations, and potential future features.

### Hypothesis
...

## Method	

Usability testing will be conducted primalily in-person. In cases where in-person sessions are not possible, a remote option will be available via Zoom. Participants will use their own Drupal CMS screens to. A remote moderator will prompt users with guiding questions (from the conversation guide). Participants will be encouraged to talk through their exploration of the revision workflow. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.

Data management will follow the [VFS-CMS research procedures](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/authoring-experience/research/research-procedures) to protect PII.

## Participants and Recruitment	
The study will be done with X benefits detail page Editors.
Usability test invitations will be sent via email.
