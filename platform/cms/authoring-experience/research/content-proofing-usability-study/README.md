# Research Plan for VFS-CMS tool, February 2020

## Goals
This research plan is for the VFS-CMS Tool - VFS-CMS team.

The VFS-CMS tool is VA.gov's content management system that provides the structured content templates, workflows and governance that help various teams at VA serve veterans accurate, accessible, up-to-date content.

Our objective for this research is to evaluate the content proofing experience within the Drupal CMS. We'll focus on the experience of benefits detail page Editors. 
* Evaluate users' mental model of what function the View screen performs in the context of the editorial workflow
* Understand the value of the View screen in the editorial workflow.
* Understand how the View screen currently fits into the users' editorial workflow.
* Evaluate comprehension of navigation and on-page interactions on the View screens.
* Understand if labels provide enough context and guidance for users to complete their tasks with confidence and ease.
* Uncover pain points, user expectations, and potential future features.
