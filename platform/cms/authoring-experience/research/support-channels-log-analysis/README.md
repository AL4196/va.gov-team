# Research Plan - VFS-CMS Support Channels Log Analysis
As a member of the CMS team design pod, I need to establish a process for analyzing interactions between CMS users and the CMS team, so that I can identify common themes to inform research and design.	

## Goals	
CMS users and CMS team members have stablished official channels for questions and answers regarding the CMS tool. This study aims to identify patterns in the content of these support channels to better understand the nature of the demands and identify opportunities for improvement.

### Research Questions
- What are the most prominent usability considerations regarding the CMS tool?
- What language do CMS users use to describe their work and problems?
- What kinds of opportunities to refine CMS trainings do these findings present?
- What CMS documentation needs exist for different teams?

## Method	
For this study, we will use _Thematic Analysis_ to analyze transcripts of conversations between the CMS team and users. By identifying relevant themes, we can better understand users' paint points and needs. 

Data management will follow the [VFS-CMS research procedures](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/authoring-experience/research/research-procedures).

### Target Channels
The conversations will be extracted from:
* <b>_#cms-support_ Slack channel</b> - Responsible: Jordana Mello (jordana.mello@agile6.com)
* <b>VA CMS support email</b> - Responsible: XXX

### Data Sample
This study will look at conversations between the cms team and users occuring between January 1, 2020 and February 29, 2020.

## When? 	
Data collection will happen until February 29, 2020. Data analysis is expected to be concluded by March 20, 2020.
