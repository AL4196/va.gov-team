Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jordana and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to xxx.
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the new CMS to better meet your needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session**, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

**Once you are recording:** I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.
