# Research Plan for VFS-CMS, April 2020

## Goals
This research plan is for the VFS-CMS - VFS-CMS team.

The VFS-CMS is VA.gov's content management system that provides the structured content templates, workflows and governance that help various teams at VA serve veterans accurate, accessible, up-to-date content.

Our objective for this research is to **test a proposal for a context panel in the CMS, including the actions area, editorial workflow transition and the concept of assignments**. 

#### Solution Hypothesis
By consolidating available actions and workflow information in one single area, the proposed design gives more concrete context for the variety of actions that users can take with a revision in a specific stage of the editorial workflow, considering their role in the system.
* There is a more clearly defined context for editorial workflows (messages, assignments, revisions logs) will help all participants in the editorial process, including content editors, reviewers, and stakeholders.
* The ability to assign people to edit or review content will make it easier for content editors to understand the status of their content and move it through the editorial process more efficiently.
* Consolidating actions into a single area will help editors manage their content more quickly without unnecessary scrolling and surfaces all available options, so that they know what is possible.
* Additional information in the new actions area helps editors see the status of their content at a glance.

#### Research Questions
The research is designed to answer the following questions:
* 

Evaluate users' mental model of what function the View screen performs in the context of the editorial workflow
Understand the value of the View screen in the editorial workflow.
Understand how the View screen currently fits into the users' editorial workflow.
Evaluate comprehension of navigation and on-page interactions on the View screens.
Uncover the users' expectations for navigating to and away from the View screen.
Understand if labels provide enough context and guidance for users to complete their tasks with confidence and ease.
Uncover pain points, user expectations, and potential future features.

#### What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?
Developing a thorough understanding of how the assignments tool serves the needs of content editors, reviewers, and stakeholders and validating design solutions in the prototype to address contextualization and actions related to the editorial workflow will show our research process has been successful.

## Method	
Remote moderated usability testing will be conducted via Zoom. The moderator will prompt users with guiding questions from the conversation guide and a navigational prototype in Adobe XD will be used for the testing. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.

To record the session, we'll make an initial record using verbatim notes and zoom audio and screen recording, followed by synthesized notes on our observations.

To protect PII, we will follow data management protocols outlined by [VFS-CMS research procedures](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/authoring-experience/research/research-procedures).
