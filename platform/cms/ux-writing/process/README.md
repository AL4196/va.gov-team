# UX writing processes 

## Working on research

- Determine if scope of research study should be expanded/restricted for UX writing discovery
- Write conversation guide questions that help draw out users language concepts
- Participate as observer in user research sessions
- Be the default note taker to ensure language is captured accurately
- Perform audit of resulting data, by doing the following:
- Code data in reframer
- Pull out key codes into concepts mind map (when appropriate) + AT database
- Synthesize findings and document in back end style guide


## Planning cross-functional work

1. **Add the UX writing label as early as possible in planning**
- Team members add the maroon colored UX writing label to GitHub issues when there are words/text involved that end users will see as a part of any of the following:
  - A spike or planned design work
  - New features or new functionality 
  - Existing functionality + planned design work 
- UX writing lead is responsible for proactively adding labels in grooming and planning sessions

2. **Break out the work**
- Label epics and stories in a way that helps plan and track the work:
- For small lifts, such as **1 story point or less**: add the following AC for collaborating w/ UX writer 
  - [ ] Collaborate w/ UX writer on ____ text
  - [ ] Draft text in a format that is ready for usability testing or implementation
  - [ ] Validate draft with those responsible for the work
  - [ ] Peer review by a member of the design pod 
  - [ ] Finalize edits to text, and mark as ready to implement in the original issue
  - [ ] Document strategy behind language choices that are relevant to [the back end style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o3euR0eMoXRyp8G6sx1OCpmRtBShYGAm-Rb8MSXXir0/edit#)
- For bigger lifts, such as **2+ story points**: add an associated [UX writing task issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/cms-ux-writing.md) 
- Because gathering enough context to do the writing is often a lot more work than it seems, most work falls in category #2, so if you’re not sure, add it as its own issue.

3. **Get clear on the context**
- A UX writer and others will start collaborating by getting clear on the following:
- When/where users will see the changes
- What users might need to know about the new functionality
- What users need to do

4. **Leave room for the writing process**
- There’s always something that can be edited, even after one produces an initial draft they feel confident about. There will almost always need to be multiple drafts for text at various stages of the work, so it’s important to:
- Anticipate multiple iterations of the text, which may have technical or design implications.
- Make sure the UX writer gives a final sign off on the text before it’s implemented in a prototype or in the product.
- Editing can get messy, so The UX writer should clearly communicate what state the text is in (draft/validate/peer review/final)

5. **Give feedback**
- Peer review should always be part of the UX writing AC. Anticipate spending time giving feedback along with other members of the team.
