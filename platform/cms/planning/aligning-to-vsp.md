# Aligning CMS to VSP Tools and Processes

## Context
The VA.gov CMS is the primary means by which the modernized VA.gov initiative will get extended to hundreds of business units within VA, including 2000+ facilities, dozens of offices, and other programs and initiatives.

The CMS team will increasingly function as a platform team that onboards dozens of new VFS products, while continuing to support and improve the CMS product itself (editorial experience, governance structures, Content API, etc).

In the former function, it is important the CMS team integrate into VSP tools and processes to streamline new Product development for the enterprise. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline documentation to be added/updated, as well as suggested process modifications to achieve this objective.

## Onboarding Process
- Include CMS PM and Delivery Manager in PM Onboarding meetings for introductions, roles and responsibilities
- Update [Welcome to VSP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/onboarding/Welcome%20to%20VSP.md) with considerations for the CMS beginning to be [outlined here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/working-with-cms-team.md).
- Also consider: inclusion of Drupal Engineers in your product team, and guidelines for contributing code to Drupal

## Incident Response
- Update [incident reponse playbook](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/docs/Incident%20Response%20Playbook.md), especially for content-related incicdents such as broken links. 

## Quarterly Planning
- Work with DEPO, VSP, and CMS team leadership to identify the best way to align OKRs across the entire Platform group.
