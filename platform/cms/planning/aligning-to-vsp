#Aligning CMS to VSP Tools and Processes
##Purpose of this document   
Under our new mandate, the CMS team will function as a Platform to support and improve the editorial experience, as well as to support the onboarding of new Products to VA.gov. In the latter function, it is important the CMS team integrate into VSP tools and processes to streamline new Product development for the enterprise. This document is an initial attempt to outline documetation to be added/updated, as well as suggested process modifications to achieve this objective.
##Onboarding Process

 -Content model review
 -Alignment of visual design to the model
 -How to contribute code to the cms github repo (best practices to be written)
##Incident Response
