# Content Management System

VA.gov's content management system provides the structured content templates, workflows and governance that help various teams at VA serve veterans accurate, accessible, up-to-date content.

The CMS is built with Drupal and currently supports 4 main products at VA: 
1. Benefits hubs (eg www.va.gov/health-care and 10 other benefits hubs)
1. VAMC systems (eg www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care). Eventually housing 1200+ VHA facilities
1. Homepage and Global UX elements such as the header, footer, and homepage alerts
1. The Benefits outreach hub at https://www.va.gov/outreach-and-events/
