## Form Confirmation Page Template 

### What's the purpose of the Form Confirmation page?

The Confirmation page gives users information about what they can expect after they submit a form online. This page also provides users a summary of the benefit they applied for, a confirmation number, and the date they submitted their claim. 

Our current confirmation pages vary in format and content. Below are some of the default components on our current confirmation pages. This is the default template, but teams should tailor the content and information as needed based on the benefit type. 

In general the confirmation page should include the following elements: 

### Sample template 

1. H1: File for [benefit] or Apply for [benefit] and the VA paper form equivalency appears next to or below the H1. 

  *For example:* 
  H1: File for disability compensation (Form 21-526EZ)

2. After the H1 we should include a line of content letting users know that they can print this confirmation page. <br>
    *For example:*
    **Please print this page for your records**

3. A line of content letting users know that their application was submitted. <br>
    *For example:*
      **Thank you for submitting your application** or <br>
      **Your claim has been submitted** <br>

4. Blue box content 

{begin Blue box}
  - Applicant name
  - Benefit they’re applying for
  - Confirmation number
  - Date claim or application has been submitted
  - Other important information about their claim, such as disability conditions, they’re claiming. <br>
  
  {end blue box}

5. Other content we include on the confirmation page is based on the type of benefit.Some benefit confirmation pages might need more information for the user than others.  

  *Examples of what type of content to include:*                                         

- How long will the application take? 

- What can the applicant do while they wait? 

- Are there any actions applicant needs to take while they wait? 

- What they can do if they have additional questions after they apply?
