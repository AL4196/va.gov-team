# Team of Teams Meeting

The goal of the Team of Teams meeting is for platform teams and teams building on VA.gov to understand how you may be impacted by each others' work. Knowing what each other is working on allows for collaboration, time-savings, and ultimately the creation of more great Veteran facing services.

## Template:

**1. What are you actively working on shipping?**

*Include the name of the product or initiative, the product lifecycle phase it's in, what the current work is, and if it's in the build/validate phase, include what your anticipated launch plan and timeline is.*

Like this: 
- `Product/initiative`: `discover/define/build/validate` phase, working through `user research/business validation/prototype validation/API integration/something else` and planning to launch to `target audience` on `mm/dd/yyyy`.

**2. What changes are you introducing that may impact other teams?**

*Include a quick description of the change, and why other teams should care*

Like this:
-  We're `doing this thing` around `this time,` so `these people` make sure you `do this as a result`

**3. What blockers or dependencies are impacting your progress?**

*Include a description of the blocker, and what you need from this group to overcome it*

Like this:
- In order to `do this thing`, we need `this other thing` from `this person or team`

3. Blockers or something you need from other teams
a. I need ..... from ........ 
PGH Launch coordination activities with Dave Mazik/Jeff Dunn and TJ
b. Want to ensure the facility locator detail pages are included in our redirect request ticket
4. Q&A
Chris: why the strict password req? Note from Charles about security, so CMS checked the practices they have today and
added this one.
Chris: how many users? 4
Any concern about ppl far outside the orbit being able to do this now? W/that number, no concern. W/training we're going to
be encouraging them not to trigger tons of builds, but just use it for alerts. (also trying to get build time reduced, so builds can
be triggered more frequently w/o neg consequences)

5. Actions
