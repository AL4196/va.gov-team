* **What** is it? 
  * [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) replaces large files with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise.
* **When** do we use it?
  * When a file extension matches one of the extensions specified in the [repoâ€™s config file (`.gitattributes`)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/.gitattributes)
  * As of 2019-12-31, those extensions are:
    * `.m4v`
    * `.pdf`
    * `.sketch`
    * `.pptx`
