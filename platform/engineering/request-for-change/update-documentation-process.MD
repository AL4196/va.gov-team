## Background
Our documentation is in a woeful state with three main issues - First our documentation is not easy for developers to update. A separate pull request needs to be made to a separate repo to update documentation, this leads our documentation to not get updated as often as we should be. Second our documentation is not well organized, this leads it to not be the first place folks look for help as it is a much more direct path to simply ask in a Slack channel for help. Third our documentation does not include troubleshooting steps for most items. Our documentation tells you how to set things up but it doesn't tell you anything you can do when things do work the way they are expected to, which is often. 


## Motivation
_Why do we want to change the current implementation? What problem(s) does the change solve?_

## Design
_Explain the proposed changes in enough detail so that a team member with working knowledge 
of the project could implement the change themselves. Bonus points if this is easily mappable
to user stories or specs._

## Risks
_What are the risks of the proposed changes?_

## Alternatives
_What other alternatives solutions were considered, why weren't they chosen?_
