Welcome to the Platform Call Center Folder. This repo contains documentation about how the work of VFS Teams intersect with VA call centers.

## VFS Call Center POCs
- DSVA POC: Chante Lantos-Swett (chante.lantosswett@va.gov)
- VSP POC: Kimberley Daniels (kimberley.daniels@adhocteam.us)

## Process Documents
- [Call Center Review Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/call-center/request-contact-center-review.md) 
  * This document outlines the process for requesting a call center team review for any new or significantly updated tool/feature. This process allows the call center team to update call centers on changes to VA.gov so that call center agents can get trained to answer user issues and questions.  
- [VFS App Bugs Escalation Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/call-center/roe.md)
  * The call center team is responsible for triaging and escalating bugs to the correct VFS team. This document outlines the process for notifying VFS team of a bug and the process and timelines for responding to a reported issue. 

## Key Documents
