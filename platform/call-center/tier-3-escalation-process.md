This document outlines the process for identifying, triaging and escalating Tier 3 VA.gov issues. This document covers how the Call Center 
Team will engage VFS teams to address and resolve Tier 3 issues found in their products. 

## Tier 3 Issues and Priority Definitions

Tier 3 issues are persistent bugs that the Call Center Team has investigated and determined to be caused by a technical failure that cannot 
be resolved with standard scripts and troubleshooting steps. The Call Center Team identifies Tier 3 issues through triage work in IRIS, Salesforce, and through  
communication from call center POCs.

Once a Tier 3 issue has been identified, the Call Center Team assigns a priority to the issue based on the following criteria:

  * Low: Fewer than 10 total reported issues and a viable work around exists
  * Medium: Fewer than 10 total reported issues and no viable work around exists
  * High: 10 or more total reported issues. 
  * Urgent: 10 or more reported issues in one day. This is considered a trending issue for VA.gov call centers. 

## Assigning Issues
Once the data from each source has been entered onto the spreadsheet, copy the information to paste it in a ZH (ZenHub) ticket that will be created.  The criteria for creating a ZH ticket is as follows:
* Issue Title: Brief description of issue
    * Ex. Logon to ID.me error message
* Label: Call Center and any other department that needs research/resolve the issue
* Assignees: All Call Center team members and individuals associated with the team that is researching/resolving the issue.
    * If the Call Center team member is unsure of who the ticket should be assigned to, then it will be assigned to Triage for determination.
    
    ## Compiling Data
Once a Tier 3 issue and  has been identified, a spreadsheet will be created by the Call Center team containing:
* Date issue reported
* Ticket number
* Description of issue as stated by the customer
* Topic and Sub-topic of the issue
* ALL PII WILL BE REMOVED

## Status Requests
If a Call Center team member has not received an ETA for research or resolution from the appropriate team within 48 business hours, 
then it is the responsibility of the Call Center team to reach out through ZH to request an update.

## Lack of Communication
If there has been no status update by the end of the 48 business hours, the Call Center team member should escalate the issue to the PM of 
the team that has been assigned the issue.


## When to engage the Call Center Team
  
**General Rule:** The Call Center team will make every effort to include ALL pertinent infromation on the issue.  However, if more details are needed
- Find the appropriate ZH ticket relating to the issue
- @ all Call Center team members to be notified 
- Enter in all details or questions concerning the issue
  - Not all customers are fluid in technical terms, please attempt to use layman terminology for best responses
  - Be as detailed as possible to prevent or lessen multiple interactions with the customer which will only cause frustration
- A Call Center team member will reach out to the customer within 24 hours of the request
