# Quality Assurance Artifacts
A list of expected deliverables and explanation of their contents is listed below.  Please note that you will need access to [TestRail](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/) in order to create these artifacts.

## Created in TestRail
1. Regression Test Plan -- **Note: If you already have a regression test plan for your product's baseline in TestRail you can ignore this step.**
    - Regression test plans should represent a basic suite of test scenarios that cover the baseline functionality of your product prior to changes from your current development effort.
    - Example: [Regression Test Plan](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/index.php?/suites/view/20&group_by=cases:title&group_order=asc)
1. Test Plan
    - You will create a test plan within [TestRail](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/). The test plan is a mapping of the functional changes being developed to test cases that test them. A test plan can consists of multiple types of test (manual, automated end-to-end, and load tests).  If test cases do not exist for each change then they will need to be created.
    - Example: [Test Plan](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/index.php?/plans/view/30)
1. Test Cases
    - A link to your [TestRail](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/) test cases or an export of your test cases including their steps.
    - Example: [Test Cases](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/index.php?/suites/view/2&group_by=cases:section_id&group_order=asc)
1. Test Case Execution Logs
    - A link to your [TestRail](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/) test cases or an export of your test execution logs.
    - Example: [Test Executions](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/index.php?/runs/view/7&group_by=cases:section_id&group_order=asc)
1. Reference Test Coverage Report
    - A link to your [TestRail](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/) *Coverage for References* report or an export of your coverage map.
    - Example: [Coverage for References Report](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/index.php?/reports/view/12)
1. Issues
    - A link to your [TestRail](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/) *Summary(Defects)* report or an export of your issues discovered.
    - Example: [Summary(Defects)](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/index.php?/reports/view/14)
