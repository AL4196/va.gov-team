# Deliverables
A list of expected deliverables and explanation of their contents is listed below.  Please note that you will need access to [TestRail](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/) in order to create these artifacts.

## Quality Assurance Deliverables
1. Test Plan
    - You will create a test plan within [TestRail](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/). The test plan is a mapping of the functional changes being developed to test cases that test them. A test plan can consists of multiple types of test (manual, automated end-to-end, and load tests).  If test cases do not exist for each change then they will need to be created.
    - Example: [Test Plan](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/index.php?/plans/view/30)
2. Test Cases
    - An export from your test case management software of choice that contains each test case used in your test plan.
    - In the near future, VSP hopes to offer a test case management software that all VFS teams will have access to.
    - Example: [Test Case Template](https://drive.google.com/a/oddball.io/file/d/1Tkim8srrMdDMztG0Du_yZ60DYgVOJPLk/view?usp=sharing)
3. Test Case Execution Logs
    - An export from your test case management software of choice that contains the pass/fail runs for each of the test cases used in your test plan.
    In the near future, VSP hopes to offer a test case management software that all VFS teams will have access to.
    - Example: [Test Execution Example](https://drive.google.com/a/oddball.io/file/d/1HXW2b__NByMugChsDlOYkedFIUUoJSFh/view?usp=sharing)
4. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)
    - This artifact usually takes the form of a Word / Google Doc. The RTM artifact is a mapping from requirement / user story to test case that demonstrates how the functional changes in your product were tested for this release.
    - Example: [RTM Template](https://drive.google.com/a/oddball.io/file/d/1afaLagcGBha1lC9at6IUA7j0Ut9fhF-g/view?usp=sharing)
5. Issues
    - Please provide a list of all resolved and unresolved issues encountered in the sprint.
    - Example: [Issue Collection](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/labels/bug)
