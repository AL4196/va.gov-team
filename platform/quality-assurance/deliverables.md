# Deliverables
A list of expected deliverables and explanation of their contents is listed below.  Please note that you will need access to [TestRail](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/) in order to create these artifacts.

## Quality Assurance Deliverables
1. Test Plan
    - You will create a test plan within [TestRail](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/). The test plan is a mapping of the functional changes being developed to test cases that test them. A test plan can consists of multiple types of test (manual, automated end-to-end, and load tests).  If test cases do not exist for each change then they will need to be created.
    - Example: [Test Plan](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/index.php?/plans/view/30)
2. Test Cases
    - A link to your TestRail test cases or an export of your test cases including their steps.
    - Example: [Test Cases](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/index.php?/suites/view/2&group_by=cases:section_id&group_order=asc)
3. Test Case Execution Logs
    - A link to your TestRail test cases or an export of your test execution logs.
    - Example: [Test Executions](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/index.php?/runs/view/7&group_by=cases:section_id&group_order=asc)
4. Reference Test Coverage Report
    - A link to your TestRail *Coverage for References* report or an export of your coverage map.
    - Example: [Coverage for References Report](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/index.php?/reports/view/12)
5. Issues
    - A link to your TestRail *Summary(Defects)* report or an export of your issues discovered.
    - Example: [Summary(Defects)](https://dsvavsp.testrail.io/index.php?/reports/view/14)
