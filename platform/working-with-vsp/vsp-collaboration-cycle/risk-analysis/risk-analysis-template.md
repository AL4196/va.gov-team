# Risk Analysis Matrix Template

## Instructions
1. Create a list of risks in the table of risks and number each.
1. Place the reference number for each risk in the matrix below given your assessment of its impact and probability
1. Use the guidance in the risk rating table to assess how serious each risk is
1. Use brainstorming to examine possible risk mitigations
1. Use brainstorming to examine possible challenges to risk mitigations

|1               |             | Something happens to cause a delay in the project | The schedule is delayed by 5 business days |
|2               |             | Something happens that prevents one or more of the acceptence criteria in a user story scheduled for this sprint to be unobtainable | CI/CD pipeline is broken for entire platform |

| 1-3          | Low: May require consideration in any future changes to the work area or processes, or can be fixed immediately. |

| 10-19        | High: Requires immediate corrective action.                                                                      |
| 20-25        | Extreme: Requires immediate prohibition of the work process and immediate corrective action.                     |

## Proposed risk mitigations
1. Create well-defined user stories with clear acceptence criteria prior to beginning development

## Expected challenges to risk mitigations
1. Crashing the schedule with additional resources will create communication issues
1. Altering acceptence criteria to accommodate challenges to achieving them creates new scheduling issues and scope issues
