# Offboarding instructions for contractors

## Applicability
This applies to persons who are not Federal employees (e.g. VA or OMB), have access to this team repository, and will be leaving their project.

## Instructions
The DSVA platform team is your offboarding concierge. All you need to do is:

1. Drop a message in the [#vfs-platform-support](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/CBU0KDSB1) Slack channel stating that you will be leaving us with the following information:
- Your last day
- Your Github username
- Your email address(es), including your va.gov address if applicable
- Your project(s) team lead
2. Be available to answer any questions the platform team may have.

Other than that, thank you for your service and have an excellent day!

In the event you need to offboard someone else because they have already left, please follow the above instructions on their behalf.

## Resources
The DSVA platform team will use the offboarding issue [template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=%40batemapf&labels=offboarding&template=contractor_offboarding.md&title=%5Bfirst_name%5D+%5Blast_name%5D+offboarding+checklist) to complete your offboarding.
