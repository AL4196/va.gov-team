# Sprint 17 Beta Test for Sprint Objective + Sprint Reporting Methodology
## Short-name: ZenHub-only communication of sprint plans and reports

### Background

#### Goals
- VSP govt clients want to be closer to the work
- VSP govt clients want to reduce additional, unnecessary work for teams
- VSP govt clients need to coordinate with other teams throughout CTO/DEPO/DSVA, and need to be more transparent w/their stakeholders as to what VSP is working on / shipping

#### Problems / Pain Points
- We have several sources of truth on the work folks are doing (Sprint objectives, GitHub epics, super epics, issues, other google docs sometimes, OKRs and KPIs, Internal gov DEPO product board, ToT maybe)
- Currently using screenshots of now/next/future super epics to communicate roadmap
- The sprint objectives docs are a lot of work, and following up to ensure work is wrapped up from the sprint (and ensuring unfinished work is added to the next sprint) is a lot of work. The comment workflow, responses to comments, responses to responses, etc… requires a lot of back and forth and reminding (and flipping between the doc and github). This often leads to a leap-frogging effect to resolve potentially/apparently incomplete Sprint Objectives, so by the time we finish reviewing last Sprint’s Objectives, it’s too late to get them wrapped up in the current sprint, so they go in the following Sprint (if at all).

_**Important: these problems are related to the multiple extra layers of work tracking, NOT because teams are doing something wrong.**_

### Description of the beta
The Insights + Analytics team will pilot a new ZenHub-only way of tracking sprint plans and outcomes for Sprint 17, the whole time, keeping track of what's working well, what's not working, and what open questions or challenges this way of doing things surfaces. At the end of the sprint, the VSP clients and the Insights + Analytics team will evaluate whether to continue/expand the pilot, cut it amd return to status quo, or continue to iterate on a new way.

- Teams plan out all the issues they plan to accomplish in the sprint and place in “Current Sprint” column on ZenHub
- Teams put all of these issues in a “Sprint [#]” milestone. This list will be the replacement for the Sprint Objectives.
- DEPO can download that list of issues into a google doc or some other doc to save for contract management
- By the mid-sprint check in, teams ensure the status of their issues are in the correct columns
- Teams identify the status of the issues/objectives using the pipeline columns in ZenHub
- Teams apply new labels for “new, unplanned” and “stretch” issues as needed
- Epics do not go in those ^ columns, they go in their own Now Epics, Next Epics, Future Epics columns
- DEPO pulls epics into the DEPO product board, or mirrors them w/a link
- No more google doc comments! The leads (and everyone else) comment directly on the issue with questions.
