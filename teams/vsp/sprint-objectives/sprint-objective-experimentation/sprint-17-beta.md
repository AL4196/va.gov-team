# Sprint 17 Beta Test for Sprint Objective + Sprint Reporting Methodology
## Short-name: ZenHub-only communication of sprint plans and reports

### Background

#### Goals
- VSP govt clients want to be closer to the work
- VSP govt clients want to reduce additional, unnecessary work for teams
- VSP govt clients need to coordinate with other teams throughout CTO/DEPO/DSVA, and need to be more transparent w/their stakeholders as to what VSP is working on / shipping

#### Problems / Pain Points
- We have several sources of truth on the work folks are doing (Sprint objectives, GitHub epics, super epics, issues, other google docs sometimes, OKRs and KPIs, Internal gov DEPO product board, ToT maybe)
- Currently using screenshots of now/next/future super epics to communicate roadmap
- The sprint objectives docs are a lot of work, and following up to ensure work is wrapped up from the sprint (and ensuring unfinished work is added to the next sprint) is a lot of work. The comment workflow, responses to comments, responses to responses, etc… requires a lot of back and forth and reminding (and flipping between the doc and github). This often leads to a leap-frogging effect to resolve potentially/apparently incomplete Sprint Objectives, so by the time we finish reviewing last Sprint’s Objectives, it’s too late to get them wrapped up in the current sprint, so they go in the following Sprint (if at all).
- Important: these problems are related to the multiple extra layers of work tracking, **not** because teams are doing something wrong.
