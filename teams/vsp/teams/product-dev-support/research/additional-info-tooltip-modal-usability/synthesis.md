# Synthesis/Insights from Learn More Component User Testing

We had a total of 7 participants in our research on the learn more component. We learned in total how someone would prefer to digest more information about a question. We had one active screen reader participant and another participant who used a screen reader but did not use it during the session. After the interviews, we gathered 5 people to create an affinity map. We divided up the columns into the three patterns: Modal, accordion, and tooltip. Along with those columns, we made one on observations and recommendations. https://funretro.io/publicboard/KzKcXZa4Foel3OcV6MzvTAeCerz1/8435f207-1895-4c73-b34e-9bd311d278cd

## Insights/Reccommendations

1. Accordion works well if you have links off to deeper content. Tooltips are nice if you need a parenthetical aside to your label. We notcied that people had trouble remembering the content of the modal component once they closed out of it. 
* Traumatic brain injuries are the most common injury among veterans people have issues with cognition/attention. After each component interaction, we asked the question, "How well were you able to remember what it said in the learn more when you made the selection on the form page?" Almost half of participants mentioned outrightly that they were unable to remember the information they read in the modal. 
* "I just briefly looked at it, so I don’t remember looking at it, but I’d probably go back and read again. If I have several places to look at, I’ll take notes myself."
* "Just reading it one time, I wouldn’t remember it very well, but I'll probably go back and reread it"
* "How well could they remember the modal? Not that much, to be honest."

2. Designers need to be more cognizant about content design. Designers can think more of what can be on the page and what can stay out of the page. Ask why are you hiding this? why not just leave it out there? Minimalism is a big design trend, but we need to keep in mind that things that are hidden are not that obvious to find. 

3. A maximum length/character count for learn mores. For screen reader purposes, have a link text and not a URL. 

4. Javascript tool tips were very difficult to use and broke users' expectations. Many users were not able to click on the tooltip which further confused them because all the learn mores before were clickable. In the future we should stick with CSS tooltips that activate on tap or hover. 

5. There should be some differentiation between learn more accordion and learn more tooltip--accordion could have a carot. Tooltip could have different language like "What's this?"
