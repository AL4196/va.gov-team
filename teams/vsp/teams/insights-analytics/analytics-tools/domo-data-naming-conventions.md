## How to Name Datasets on Domo
When adding additional data to Domo, please follow this naming convention in order to create a cleaner dataset environment. 

`dashboard or VFS team name - dataset description - dataset source`

---

**Examples**:

A CSV comes from the VCL Call Center. This particular dataset is going to be added to the Covid dashboard.

`covid - VCL - contact centers`

Search time results are connected from Google Analytics. This particular dataset is going to be added to the Facility Locator Product Success Tool.

`facility locator - search time - GA`

**This may change when we switch over to BigQuery.*
