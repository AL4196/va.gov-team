### Goal
To gauge how effective the KPI workshops are with VFS teams.

### Key takeaways
- Prior to the workshop, teams had begun discussing pain points and objectives, but had not solidified plans for how to measure their improvements.
- After the workshop, 8/10 participants felt confident about their team's approach to setting KPIs
- Teams expect having collectively set KPIs will help them stay focused and guide their roadmaps
- Workshop served as catalyst to discussions that had started, and help move teams forward to action. 2 participants described next steps as narrowing down the list of metrics to the most critical to track, another described setting up metrics to gather baseline data.

**How might we...**
- Follow up with teams to see if they took the next steps they described?

- Team: Service Design team
- Method: Qualitative interviews and survey
- Participants: 6 interviewees, 18 survey respondents
- [Readout in Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/product-discovery/roe-documentation/roe-research-presentation.pdf)

### Goal
To understand if people know what rules of engagement documents are, how they can find them, and if they are effective.

### Key takeaways
- *Rules of Engagement (ROE)* is an unfamiliar reference for most participants
- 11/18 VSP team members don't know if VFS teams are using their practice area documentation

**How might we statements are covered in the team's synthesis doc linked to above**
