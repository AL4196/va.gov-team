# GitHub Repo Best Practices
Determine where your file should go and how to name them...

## Folder and File Naming
- lower case words separated by dashes
- do not use spaces or special characters (i.e. &, :, %, etc.)
- omit unnecessary words (i.e. the, a, and, etc.) when it makes sense
- If multiple versions of a file exist, name consistently and include versioning info (i.e. date, v1, etc) at the end of the file name

## Public versus Private
- see guidelines on public versus private (insert link)

## Large Files
- need to land on some guidelines and how to handle with Andrew and leadership team

## Platform, Products and Teams oh my! (Where Does My File Belong?)
- define each area and provide example files types

## When to Create Child Folders
- keep structure as flat as possible
- only create new folders when there are an extensive amount of files and there is clear categorization 
- use a folder's README.md file to help users find their files rather than creating more folders - read me files allow you to group things and change those groupings as your files grow and change
