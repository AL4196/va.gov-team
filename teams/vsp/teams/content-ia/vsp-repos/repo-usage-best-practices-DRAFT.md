# Using the va.gov-team Repo
Determine where your file should go and how to name them...

## Platform, Products and Teams oh my! (Where Does My File Belong?)
- define each area and provide example files types


## Folder and File Naming
When  naming a new folder or markdown file in this repo, please adhere to the guidelines below.  This helps to keep our repo file URLs short and readable as well as ensure the repo can be cloned easily without errors. While these are specific to GitHub folders and markdown files, we recommend following these for all files that are uploaded. 

- lower case words separated by dashes
  - The only exception to this rule is the README.md file that should exist in every folder.  This file should be all capital letters for visibility.
- do not use spaces or special characters (i.e. &, :, %, etc.) if file or folder names
- omit unnecessary words (i.e. the, a, and, etc.) when it makes sense
- If multiple versions of a file exist, name consistently and include versioning info (i.e. date, v1, etc) at the end of the file name

Bad folder and file structure:  Products/Claim and Appeal Status/Phase 1 mtg notes & next steps.md
Good folder and file structure: products/claim-appeal/status/mtg-notes-phase-1-09042019.md

**Tips for naming files**
- Name your files so that they are easily findable in a list and make sense to anyone who may be looking for them.  Include key descriptive words and a date (if applicable).  
- Be consistent when naming files that are similar types - like meeting notes, retro notes, etc. 
- Consider how the files may sort within a long list - do you want to see similar types of files together, or do you want to see them by date?
  - Start broad and end with specifics to group similar things together - i.e. mtg-notes-sprint-2-planning-09012019.md
  - Start with a date to order things chronologically - i.e. 09012019-mtg-notes-sprint-2-planning

## When to Create Child Folders
- keep structure as flat as possible
- only create new folders when there are an extensive amount of files and there is clear categorization 
- use a folder's README.md file to help users find their files rather than creating more folders - read me files allow you to group things and change those groupings as your files grow and change

## Public versus Private
- All content related to development on VA.gov belongs in the public `va.gov-team repository` when possible. However, there are a limited number of reasons that content should remain private and therefore stored on the private `va.gov-team-sensitive` repo. 
- [See guidelines on using public versus private repos](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/policies-work-norms/sensitive-guidance.md)

## File Storage and Large Files
- If you are uploading files such as jpegs, xls, pdf, etc, it can be helpful to create a `files` folder in your area to keep your key folders clean and keep key documentation findable.  The files can then be linked to from a markdown file so they are easily findable. 
- Try to avoid uploading large files whenever possible.
