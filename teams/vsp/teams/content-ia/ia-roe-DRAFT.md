## Working with IA
This document will help all teams working on VA.gov understand when you should engage IA resources for collaboration and support.
All teams building on the Veteran Services Platform should follow VA.gov IA best practices and guidelines and work with an IA resource to ensure all content is easily findable and we maintain a consistent navigation experience across the site. 

## What does IA do?
>*”Information Architecture focuses on organizing, structuring, and labeling content…The goal is to help users find information and complete tasks.“* - Usability.gov


**There are 2 primary focus areas of IA on VSP:**
-	**Site IA** = The overall structure and organization of all content and tools on VA.gov. The structure impacts content design, page flow, URLs, labeling and SEO. 
-	**Navigation Design** = The flow, labeling and UI of all navigation elements and the identification of primary entry points and key cross-linking opportunities.  This includes top and left navigation components, home and hub page links, the breadcrumb, footer links, related link components, inline content links, etc.  

**Tools and methodologies used**
-	Content inventories
-	Competitive/comparitiveanalysis
-	User interviews
-	Card sorting
-	Tree testing

**Best Practices**
-	Keep organizational structure as flat as possible
-	[Follow URL guidelines and best practices] *add link*
-	Choose entry points and crosslinking placements that enhances a user’s natural path
-	[XML Sitemap guidelines] *add link*
-	[IA & Usage Guidelines for specific page templates] *add link*

**What informs IA?**  *Not sure if we need this...not complete, random thoughts*
-	User research and feedback 
-	Analytics and insights
-	SEO
-	Content relationships
-	Value and priority of content
-	User flow

## When to request IA resources
It is beneficial to engage IA resources as early as possible when you begin work on a page, product or tool.  Including IA in your team’s product kick-off meeting, or similar meeting, will help provide background, scope and timing, so we can best determine how to work together through your project. 
Understanding goals and scope of the content/tool you are working on will help us in evaluating IA and navigation solutions.  We will look at similar content/tools within the VA.gov ecosystem, discuss if user research is needed, etc. 
Involving an IA resource earlier in your project will help avoid structural changes down the line. 

**Where IA resources can help in your project:**
* **User Research Design and Results** Review discussion guides and prototypes for navigation design and labeling, and look at how findability of your content/tool can be included as part of your research. Use results from your research to inform IA and navigation approach. 
* **Design and Protype Development** Provide feedback on navigational elements of designs and prototypes.
* **Content Development/Writing** Provide feedback and insights on structuring content.  Content elements are used to determine pages names/URLs. 
* **Developer/CMS Documentation** Provide final URLs, navigation labels and placement, redirect needs, XML sitemap direction, …

Outside of these phases, IA resources can be requested any time a team thinks they could benefit from collaboration or review.
