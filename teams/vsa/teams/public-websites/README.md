## How we work
### Workflow + Cadence
#### Stand-up
Check in on people and product progress

- Daily @ 11:30a ET (except Tuesdays)
- 15 min
- 3 Question Format: What I did yesterday? What will I do today? Any impediments?

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ 1pm ET
- 2 hours

#### Retro
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improvemed, what questions people have, and any action items

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ 11:30a ET
- 1 hour

#### Grooming
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint

- 2nd Thursday of every sprint
- 1 hour
- _any other notes you have_

#### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the [Standard Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=standard-issue.md&title=):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: _your team's labels_
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint
