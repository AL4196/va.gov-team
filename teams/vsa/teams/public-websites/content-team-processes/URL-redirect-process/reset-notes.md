# Mikki and Danielle review of where we're at with parity, rewriting, and redirects
**April 17, 2020**

## Health care

Complete back in July 2019. No decisions or action items.

## Pensions

Complete except for the protected rates page.

Redirect of protected rates page was put on hold on April 2 as part of larger discussion of how to handle historical rates. Refer to issue [#2212](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/dsva-5e0105febd078d9165e53a99/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/2212).

But before we can do the redirect, we need to finish the rewriting, move the page from GitHub to Drupal, and get SME approval. The page was sent to SMEs for review back in July 2019. The last note is from Danielle providing SME feedback email before leaving the contract, but it looks like there was no follow-up on that. We need to address that feedback, but it's been so long now, we also need to sent it back through SME approval. Again, since it's been so long, we also need to do another comparison of the rewritten and legacy pages to ensure our rewritten page reflects the current, accurate factual info from the legacy page. Refer to old Vets repo issue [#18514][https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/18514). 

**DECISIONS:** 

- Keep redirect issue in backlog for now until we've completed rewriting approval process.
- Implement historical rates solution from issue [#6937](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/dsva-5e0105febd078d9165e53a99/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/6937) as part of rewriting process.

**ACTION ITEM:** 

- Danielle to create a new rewriting isssue based on where we left off on issue #18514, and work with Stephanie to prioritize and assign the right team members to the tasks. Associated tasks will include:
  - Incorporate SME feedback
  - Do a side-by-side comparison of the rewritten & legacy pages to bring over any new/different info
  - Migrate the rewritten page from GitHub to Drupal
  - Implement solution for relevant historical rates pages
  - Do a final proof of the new Drupal page
  - Send the page back to SME for final approval
  - Incorporate any additional SME feedback, and capture SME approval in documentation
  - Re-start redirect process at this time (when rewritten page is ready & approved)

- Danielle and Mikki to check in on the historical rates issue to make sure it's moving forward.

## Disability

Refer to issue #6807.

**Need to check with Nick about how to figure out how to redirect 2 pages that are treated differently from a technical perspective:**
- C&P claim exam
- Add or remove a dependent

**ACTION ITEM:** Mikki to dig into where we left on with this and will determine next steps. When we have that figured out, Danielle to do a last audit of current legacy page vs. our page before we tell SMEs we're redirecting.

**Need to double check all redirects to determine:**
- What's been directed?
- What hasn't been redirected?
- What do we need to do to finish it?

**ACTION ITEM:** Mikki to go through spreadsheet and check all redirects and post update here.

## Education

**For rates pages:**
- Danielle to edit old Github rates pages. This is going to require going back to the pages to check current information since it's been so long now.
- Randi to do copy edit & build pages in Drupal
- Peggy review? (depending on VSP review requirement/capacity)
- SME reviews of rewriting (SME review must come before redirect issue starts)
- Pick up on issue #2211

**Compare benefits page:**

Refer to issue #17817 for rewriting (old Vets repo) and #2211 for redirect.

**ACTION ITEM:** Danielle to dig in and follow up.

**Restoration of benefits:**

Refer to issue #17696 for rewriting (old Vets repo). Last step was Danielle signing off to send to SMEs back in July, and Randi asking about how to do that in August.

**ACTION ITEM:** Danielle to dig in and follow up.

**STEM scholarship:**

Refer to issue #19263 for rewriting (old Vets repo). We had paused this due to IA discussions. Need to pick back up on it there.

**ACTION ITEM:** None right now.

**Yellow Ribbon:**

Main yellow ribbon page was completed and redirected as part of parity effort.

Conversations are in progress around how to handle the historic rates. Need to check in with Liz on the status of those conversations.

**ACTION ITEM:** Mikki to check in with Liz. 

## Careers (Voc Rehab)

Careers is complete except for one rates page. Refer to issue #18324 for rewriting (old Vets repo).

Mikki/Danielle sent their affected pages/questions doc sent to SMEs in May 2019. Last email response is from Misty and says the policy folks are looking at the document. Need to figure out how best to follow up on this.

Epic #18107 and issue #18324 for rewriting (in old Vets repo). 

## Life insurance

Parity work and relevant redirects complete.

Refer to issue #2213 to see the pages that we need to rewrite. There seems to be confusion around this in the ticket. All of the pages were in various states of rewriting. We need to finish that work, get SME approval, and then we can implement redirects. All of the information we need is in Danielle's rewriting issues (linked to from Mikki's redirect issue).

**ACTION ITEM:** Danielle to look at old tickets and come up with plan for editing/auditing/building in Drupal/moving through SME reviews & approvals.

## Housing 

Everything is complete.

## Burials

Complete except for the **Find a cemetery** page. Refer to issue #3021. We would like to have another conversation about the best way to handle this page.

**ACTION ITEM:** Mikki and Danielle to reconsider and make proposal and post in issue.

## Records

Refer to #2216. Page is in records, but focuses on burials. It should therefore live in burials, and should be linked to from the "Get your military records" page as a crosslink.

**Note:** We also have information from VBA about the records they accept. This can be something we tackle later. We can also follow up with VHA 

**DECISIONS:** 
- Move page to burials. 
- Close #2216.
- Create 2 new issues (1 for moving burials documents page into burials and 1 for backlog to tackle VBA documents later).

**ACTION ITEM:** 
- Mikki to close ticket #2216 and create the new issues.
- Danielle to assign/work with team on new issue when created.
