## Health care

Complete

## Pensions

Complete except for the protected rates page (issue #2212).

## Disability

Refer to issue #6807.

Need to check with Nick about how to figure out how to redirect 2 pages that are treated differently from a technical perspective:
- C&P claim exam
- Add or remove a dependent

Need to double check all redirects to determine:
- What's been directed?
- What hasn't been redirected?
- What do we need to do to finish it?

## Education

**For rates pages:**
- Danielle to edit old Github rates pages. This is going to require going back to the pages to check current information since it's been so long now.
- Randi to do copy edit & build pages in Drupal
- Peggy review? (depending on VSP review requirement/capacity)
- SME reviews
- Pick up on issue #2211

**Compare benefits page:**

Refer to #17817 for rewriting and #2211 for redirect.
