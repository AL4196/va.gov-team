## Health care

Complete back in July.

## Pensions

Complete except for the protected rates page (issue #2212).

## Disability

Refer to issue #6807.

Need to check with Nick about how to figure out how to redirect 2 pages that are treated differently from a technical perspective:
- C&P claim exam
- Add or remove a dependent

Need to double check all redirects to determine:
- What's been directed?
- What hasn't been redirected?
- What do we need to do to finish it?

## Education

**For rates pages:**
- Danielle to edit old Github rates pages. This is going to require going back to the pages to check current information since it's been so long now.
- Randi to do copy edit & build pages in Drupal
- Peggy review? (depending on VSP review requirement/capacity)
- SME reviews of rewriting (SME review must come before redirect issue starts)
- Pick up on issue #2211

**Compare benefits page:**

Refer to issue #17817 for rewriting (old Vets repo) and #2211 for redirect.

**Restoration of benefits:**

Refer to issue #17696 for rewriting (old Vets repo). Last step was Danielle signing off to send to SMEs back in July, and Randi asking about how to do that in August.

**STEM scholarship:**

Refer to issue #19263 for rewriting (old Vets repo). We had paused this due to IA discussions. Need to pick back up on it there.

**Yellow Ribbon:**

Main yellow ribbon page was completed and redirected as part of parity effort.

Conversations are in progress around how to handle the historic rates. Need to check in with Liz on the status of those conversations. 

## Careers (Voc Rehab)

Careers is complete except for one rates page. Refer to issue #18324 for rewriting (old Vets repo).

Mikki/Danielle sent their affected pages/questions doc sent to SMEs in May 2019. Last email response is from Misty and says the policy folks are looking at the document. Need to figure out how best to follow up on this.

Epic #18107 and issue #18324 for rewriting (in old Vets repo). 

## Life insurance

Parity work and relevant redirects complete.

Refer to issue #2213 to see the pages that we need to rewrite. There seems to be confusion around this in the ticket. All of the pages were in various states of rewriting. We need to finish that work, get SME approval, and then we can implement redirects. All of the information we need is in Danielle's rewriting issues (linked to from Mikki's redirect issue).

## Housing 

Everything is complete.

## Burials

Complete except for the **Find a cemetery** page. Refer to issue #3021. We would like to have another conversation about the best way to handle this page.
