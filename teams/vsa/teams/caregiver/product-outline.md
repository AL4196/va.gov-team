# Executive Summary

## User Problem Statement

As a caregiver, it's difficult to apply for and manage benefits from the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC).

## Solution Goals

### User Goals
- Caregivers want to be able to fill out the 1010-CG online.
- Caregivers want to understand PCAFC eligibility and requirements.
- Caregivers want to track the status of their application.
- Caregivers want to be able to manage the benefits for themselves and the Veterans they care for
- Caregivers want to have a single source of information relevant to being a Caregiver.
- Caregivers want to be able to contact a support person from the VA.

### Business Goals
- Feed application data directly to CARMA
- Accomodate the influx of applications that's expected due to changing program eligibility

## Assumptions
- Caregivers and Veterans will fill out the 1010-CG online form rather than the paper form


## Requirements and Constraints
- The paper 1010-CG requires wet signatures from both the Veteran and the Caregiver
- Many caregivers are used to filling out forms on behalf of their veterans
- Caregiver/Veteran relationships may change
- Some Veterans want to give their Caregiver access to all medical and benefits information, while others would not
 

## Discovery Takeaways
- Users like the idea of an online form
- Users like the ability to save the form in progress
- Users like the ability to download a submission receipt
- Mutliple online sources offer conflicting information
- Caregivers like the idea of having an online portal to access support, resources, and benefit information
