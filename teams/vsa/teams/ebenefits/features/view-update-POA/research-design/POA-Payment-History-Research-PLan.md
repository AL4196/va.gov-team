# Research Plan for [eBenefits]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits), [Power of Attorney and Payment History]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/features/view-update-POA), 3/26/2020

## Goals        
The VA’s eBenefits program enables Veterans and Caregivers to access and manage, benefits provided by the VA. The VSA eBenefit team [mission]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/charter.md).

View My Representative
The current eBenefits “View My Representative” (VMR) overarching purpose was to digitize the VA's Power of Attorney forms 21-22 and 21-22a. <br>

The three main features to the VMR
 - A form wizard or application process
 - Selecting a representative
 - Manage the elected representative.  
 
View My Payments
The current eBenefits "View My Payment History" (PH) consolidates VA payments history into a single application. There are two main features of PH. First, is Payments Made, and second, Payment Returned. <br>

Payment table headers:<br>
 - Date (of payment)
 - Type (of payment which office made a payment
 - Account (payable to)
 - Instituion (payable to)
 - Amount (paid or returned)

**The Research's Goal:**
Our goal is to conduct interviews:
 - Document the user's expectations of the tool. 
 - Note the user's pain points.
 - Access the user's level of comprehension of the tasks. 
 
**The research questions we want to address are:**
- Where is the best place to have this form in the IA?  (POA/PH)
- Where would users want to find it? (POA/PH)
- Is the wizard intuitive to the veterans? (POA) 
- Is the information presented clearly? (POA)
- Do Veterans understand what the different Power of Attorney steps mean? (POA)
- Do users understand how to fill in each field? (POA)
- What do users think will happen after they’ve submitted the form? (POA)
- What information do Veterans expect to see in the search results? (POA)
- How do users navigate the representative results? (POA)
- What other tools/sites do vets use to fill out the Power Of Attorney Form? (POA)
- How do veterans determine to employ a representative to dispute their claims? (POA)
- What information do Veterans expect to see in the Payment tables? (PH)
- How do users navigate the Payment table? (PH)
- What other tools/sites do vets use to confirm payments made? (POA)

 
**Our hypothesis**   
POA: Is the user will easily navigate through the wizard and efficiently locate, find, and select their representative but, the following issues may arise:
- Clearly understanding the component's shift from a wizard to a search feature back to a wizard.
- Realizing whether or not the veteran understands their rights have been legally “handed over.”

PH: Is the veteran will have two principal ways they will use the tool.  First, expected features should be centered around efficiently searching for a particular payment or a period of payments. Secondly, the veteran will also like to view only the last several (5-10) payments/returns.

## Method
**What method of research are you planning?** <br>
- Method: Directed interviews
- Participants: Veterans who utilize View My Representative and View My Payments features on eBenefits
- Location: Remote, Zoom meeting coordinated by Perigeon.
- Recruitment of interviewees: Perigeon

**Why this help you answer your research questions?** <br>
Zoom is the best way to reach an array of veterans while minimizing environmental impacts. It also reduces some of the complexity of in-person interviews.  

## Participants and Recruitment
**What is your recruitment strategy?** <br>
Perigeon will recruit the remote users <br>

 **Participant criteria** <br>
 - 8 Veterans
 - Must receive payments from the VA 
 - Must have a VSO or Attorney representative disputed claim.
 - Include a mix of Veterans with a disability rating of 80% or higher.

## Timeline of Research 
- **Interview dates:** April 6th, 2020 - April 10th, 2020
- **Need document completion date:** Conversation guided April 2nd

## Sessions
- **Length of sessions:** 45m-1h <br>

Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? <br>
- TBD
- (December 13, 9:30 am - 3:00 pm EST.  example text)
- _Note: Please leave a minimum of 30 minutes between sessions._
