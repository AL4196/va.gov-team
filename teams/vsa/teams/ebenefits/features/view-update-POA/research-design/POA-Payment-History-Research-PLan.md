# Research Plan for eBenefits Form 21-22 & 21-22a Power of Attorney and Payment History

#### VSA eBenefits Team / 21-22 & 21-22a Migration & Moderization

#### Background 
The VA’s eBenefits program enables Veterans and Caregivers to access and manage, benefits provided by the VA. The VSA eBenefit team [mission]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/charter.md).

##### View My Representative
The current eBenefits “View My Representative” (VMR) overarching purpose was to digitize the VA's Power of Attorney forms 21-22 and 21-22a. There are three main features to the VMR: A form wizard or application process, selecting a representative to manage the disputed claim, and managing the elected representative. Although the process is not very complicated, it is important the veteran clearly understood that they are allicating their claim rights to a legal representative. 
 
##### View My Payments
The current eBenefits "View My Payment History" (PH) consolidates VA payments history into a single application. There are two main features of PH. First, is Payments Made, and second, Payment Returned. 

Payment table headers:<br>
 - Date (of payment)
 - Type (of payment which office made a payment
 - Account (payable to)
 - Institution (payable to) 
 - Amount (paid or returned)

### Hypothesis   
#### Power of Attorney
Our hypothesis is, the veteran will easily navigate through the wizard and efficiently locate, find, and select their representative, but the following issues may arise:
- Clearly understanding the component's shift from a wizard to a search feature back to a wizard.
- Realizing whether or not the veteran understands their rights have been legally “handed over.”

#### Payment History
Our hypothesis is, the veteran will have two principal ways they will use the tool.  First, expected features should be centered around efficiently searching for a particular payment or a period of payments. Secondly, the veteran will also like to view only the last several (5-10) payments/returns.
