# Research Plan for [eBenefits]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits), [Power of Attorney and Payment History]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/features/view-update-POA), 3/26/2020

## Goals   	 
The VA’s eBenefits program enables Veterans and Caregivers to access and manage, benefits provided by the VA. The VSA eBenefit team [mission]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/charter.md) is to `‘Transform benefits products into personalized, guided experiences that help Veterans and the people in their network get the benefits and service they deserve.’`

View My Representative
The current eBenefits “View My Representative” (VMR) overarching purpose was to digitize the VA's Power of Attorney forms 21-22 and 21-22a. <br>

The three main features to the VMR
 - A form wizard or application process
 - Selecting a representative
 - Manage the elected representative.  
 
View My Payments
The current eBenefits "View My Payment History" (PH) consolidates VA payment history into a single application allowing the veteran to see each payment made. There are two main feature of PH. First is Payments made and second Payment returend to the veteran. <br>

Payment information that is displayed is:<br>
 - Date of payment
 - Tpye of payment (which office made a payment)
 - Account payable to
 - Instituion payable to
 - Amount paid or returned

**The Research's Goal:**
Our goal is to conduct interviews:
 - Document user's expectations of the tool. 
 - Note the user's pain points.
 - Access the user's level of comprehension of the tasks. 

 
**The research questions we want to address are:**
- Where is the best place to have this form in the IA?  
- Where would users want to find it?
- Are users able to navigate through the form easily and without hiccups?
- Is information displayed in a clear and understandable manner (text/components)?
- Do users understand how to fill in each field?
- Do users have a sense of where they are in the site and within user path?
- Do applicants understand requirements and are next steps transparent?
- What do users think will happen after they’ve submitted the form?
- What do users want to happen after submitting the form?
- How easy/difficult is it for a user to find a facility?
- What ways do users navigate to the facility locator?
- What search criteria should be present so that Veterans can find facilities?
- What information do Veterans expect to see in the search results?
- Do Veterans understand what the different facility classifications mean?
- How do Veterans distinguish emergency, urgent, and community care facilities?
- What other tools/sites do vets use to find facilities or services?
 
**Our hypothesis**   
My hopythesis is that most veterans will have complete a very amount of work before starting the form. I also beleive that layers or VSO will largley drive/aid the veteran throught this process. Mostly by being present when the form is completed or having the veteran complete paper work before mailing this in. Resulting in a proces of checking steps. 

The form's navigation easily, however the folloing issues my arise:
- Clearly understanding the componts shift from wizard to search feature to wizard
- Understanding whether or not the veteran rights have been legaly “handed over”
- Understanding what a secondary caregiver is, and if they should care about that

## Method
**What method of research are you planning?** <br>
- Methoid: Directed interviews
- Participants: Veterans who utlizes View My Representative and View My Payments features on eBenefits
- Location: Remote, Zoom meeting cordinated by Perigeon.
- Recruitment of interviewees: Perigeon

**Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?** <br>
This is the easiest way to talk with Veterans about their experience with the ordering process since our team does not have access to the current ordering systems. There are a variety of ways a Veteran can order, including live agent phone lines, automated phone line, paper form, online form, and through their VHA provider - therefore, we will need to branch our line of questioning depending on the Veteran’s preferred ordering method(s).


## Participants and Recruitment
**What is your recruitment strategy?** <br>
Perigion will recruit the remote users <br>

 **Participant criteria** <br>
 - 8 Veterans
 - Must recieve payments from the VA 
 - Must have a VSO or Attorney representative a current disbueted claim.
 - Include a mix of Veterans with a disability rating of 80% or higher.
