## Intro - 5 minutes
My name is Nick, and thank you for joining us today.  Before we go any further, I'd like to make you aware that I have my colleagues on the line who will be observing and taking notes.  Today, we're going to walk through the Power of Attorney form and the Payment History feature on the VA's eBenefits website. 

Before we begin, there are a few things I wanted to mention:

- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you too long, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinion.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - **If you're okay with me recording, once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session again.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"**
