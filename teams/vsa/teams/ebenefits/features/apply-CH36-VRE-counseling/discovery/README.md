# Initial notes on Education and Career Counseling (Ch36)
March 25, 2020

## Background
Chapter 36 is refering to [Title 38 of the US legal code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/3697A) (check breadcrumbs) but doesn't really convey context, so when outside the team, try to use "Education and Career Counseling."  (Title 38 is all about Veteran Benefits.  All the work we do, the power of the VA to provide benefits to the Veteran and their dependents, derives from this language.)  Technically anyone who is elgible for education assistance including CH33, which GI Bill, is also eligble for this benefit.

## General
This current EBN feature allows a Veteran to apply for education and career counseling services as they move out of service.  This is overseen by the TED (Transitional Education Development) Office.  It is a simple process where an authenticated Veteran walks up to the request and submits contact and historical information to the TED Office via Central Mail.  Currently there is a confirmation notification that the request has been submitted.

If you are not logged in and you still want to apply for Chapter 36, you should be able to. We may need adjust the static landing page to accomadate an unauthenticated user with a form that captures the relevant information manually instead of pre-filling.
