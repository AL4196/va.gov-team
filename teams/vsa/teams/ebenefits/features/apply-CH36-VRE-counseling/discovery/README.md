# Initial notes on Education/ Career Counseling (Ch36)
March 25, 2020

## Background & Paper Form
Chapter 36 is refering to [Title 38 of the US legal code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/3697A) (check breadcrumbs) but doesn't really convey context, so when outside the team, try to use "Education/ Career Counseling."  (Title 38 is all about Veteran Benefits.  All the work we do, the power of the VA to provide benefits to the Veteran and their dependents, derives from this language.)  Technically anyone who is elgible for education assistance including CH33, which GI Bill, is also eligble for this benefit.  All benefits that the VA offers, roll up to a single Veterans eligibility.  However you are related to that Veteran, thats how your eligibility is formed.

The paper form is [28-8832](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-28-8832-ARE.pdf) and starts with applicant information (**PART I - APPLICANT INFORMATION**), the next two parts are relevant where the Veteran may not be the one applying (**PART II - INFORMATION CONCERNING DISABLED OR DECEASED VETERAN OR INDIVIDUAL ON ACTIVE DUTY**, **PART III - SPECIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING APPLICANT**) where there is also a section asking if there has been an application for any of the following benefits: 
```diff
13.
A. VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION BENEFITS (Chapter 31)
B. VETERANS' EDUCATION ASSISTANCE BASED ON YOUR OWN SERVICE (Specify benefit)
C. DEPENDENTS' EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE (Chapter 35)
D. SURVIVORS' AND DEPENDENTS EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE (Complete Items 14A and 14B) on reverse)
E. OTHER (Specify)
F. NONE
```
Another notable section is **PART IV - APPLICANT'S MILITARY SERVICE** where more service information is requested.

The last two parts are centered around signatures (**PART V - CERTIFICATION AND SIGNATURE OF APPLICANT**, **PART VI - SIGNATURE OF PARENT, GUARDIAN, OR CUSTODIAN**)

## General Notes on Current Application
This current EBN feature allows a Veteran to apply for education and career counseling services as they move out of service.  This is overseen by the TED (Transitional Education Development) Office.  It is a simple process where an authenticated Veteran walks up to the request and submits contact and historical information to the TED Office via Central Mail.  Currently there is a confirmation notification that the request has been submitted.

If you are not logged in and you still want to apply for Chapter 36, you should be able to. We may need adjust the static landing page to accomadate an unauthenticated user with a form that captures the relevant information manually instead of pre-filling.

This feature can be found in EBN, after logging in, under Additional Benefits (Under "Things you can view here:") / Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment and can be initiated by clicking the blue button "Request Counseling."
