## FE & BE meeting Agenda topics

### What is the current data structure being used by the BE?


### What is the current data structure being created by the FE?

Each "page" in each workflow comes through as a separate JSON object, for instance the veteran information and the veteran address are two separate pages so they come through as two separate JSON objects, is this ok for BE?

the structure we have will most likely need to follow the workflows but can be wrapped in objects.

### What conventions do we need to agree on (i.e. do all states come through as just a two digit abbreviation)?


### What are the known limitations for the BE (if any)?


### What are the known limitations for the FE (if any)?
