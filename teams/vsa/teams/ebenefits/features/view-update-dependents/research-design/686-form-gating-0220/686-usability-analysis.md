## Research goals
**Some background:** VA uses the 21-686c (686) form to collect and process the information to allow a Veteran to add dependents to their disability claim. The same form is used to remove dependents who have died or otherwise left the household of the Veteran.

The 686 is 12 pages in its paper incarnation, and it supports eight discrete workflows (eBenefits adds the 21-674). Once deployed to VA.gov, the 686 will be one of the site’s  longer, more complex forms . The new 686 must be developed within the conventions and constraints of the VA.gov form system. Usability testing will be critical to uncovering potential problems in the prototype workflows--and illuminating the solutions that will provide an optimal user experience.


**Our research goals:** The over-arching business goal of the 686 is the quick automatic processing of the greatest number of digitally submitted forms. To support this, the new digital version of the form must be as clear and succinct as possible to increase accuracy and reduce abandonment.

- Is the checkbox selection an acceptable way for users to enter the form?
- What support will users need to navigate and successfully submit the form?
- Have we properly "chaptered" the various business workflows?
- What problems arise from longer/complicated chapter combinations?

**Our hypotheses:** The 686 is a long and complicated form in its entirety, but the digital version should prove more user-friendly with user-selectable workflows and "step-by-step" chapter-based screens.

- Users will accept the checkbox selection of multiple forms but will be wary about picking too many workflows at once
- Users will require clarification or guidance at various points; The upload feature may create some confusion/frustration with its position at the end of the form
- Users may not be immediately aware of the change in workflow "chapters" as they navigate the form
- Some users will find the add-spouse workflow will be problematic in its length and the repetitive section of former marriages. The "remove" dependent flows will be easily understood


## Research methodology 

**Our methodology:** Usability testing was conducted remotely using  Zoom. Participants were spilt into two groups and were given either  “add spouse & child/remove child” or “add student/remove student” tasks. Both groups were given wayfinding, intro, selection, review and confirmation tasks.  Users were presented with a high-fidelity prototype created using Adobe XD.

The moderator prompted users with tasks and questions from the conversation guide. Participants were encouraged to talk through their exploration of the prototypes, and to speak candidly about their impressions. Remote observers and note takers were in attendance, and all sessions were recorded.

**Who we talked to:**
- Eight Veterans total, all with a 30% or higher disability rating
- Four have experience adding spouse to disability benefits
- Three have experience claiming children over 18 enrolled in school
- One has a child and will go through the process of claiming them for college in five years 
- One Veteran with 80% or higher disability rating and cognitive disabilities
- Geographically diverse: MD, CA, FL, IA, PA 
- Participant ages ranged from 25-74 years
- Two were familiar with the 21-686c


**Our guiding questions:**
- Do participants understand the 21-686c is a multi-purpose form? And do they understand and accept the "checkbox" selection of the various 686 workflows?
- Are the forms presented clearly and easy to understand by Veterans?
- Where do users need examples, guidance or section headers as they interact with the form?
- Where are the pain points in the longer workflows (add-spouse/add-child, add-student)?
- What are users' experiences with the current 21-686c (paper, digital, VSO, etc.)?
- Do participants know they have to reports changes in their dependents' status?
- What workflow combinations (scenarios) do users think are likely?

## Key findings
**Our top findings:**
- Participants initially expected to find the 21-686c in the VA.gov Family Benefits or Records sections.
- Users generally scanned the introduction page, but stated they found the level of guidance acceptable; however, once they were completing the form, they wanted additional information up-front.
- No participant seemed to notice there were two forms presented: 21-686c and 21-674.
- Participants universally accepted the "checkbox" workflow selection strategy, and most stated they preferred to handle multiple workflows in one session.
- Participants accepted the "wrokflow" arragement of the form without question.
- Additional explanation and guidance is needed for certain key sections of the form (e.g. student address, marriage types and term dates).
- The former marriage sections of the add spouse workflow was deemed accaptable.
- The presentation of the introduction page, confirmation page, and the form itself was generally acceptable to users.
- Generally, users moved through the longers workflows of the form quickly, with little prompting.
- Many participants wanted printable versions of their form submission and/or a confirmation number as proof of submission; several asked for a "print" button.

## Details of findings
**Wayfinding = wandering:**
Participants started on the VA.gov home page with a task to find where they could add/remove dependent from their disability claim. Users could pursue multiple paths.

- Half (50%) of participants looked for links in the white quadrants
- 50% looked at the megamenu
- One-quarter (25%) used the search feature
- Three participants (37.5%) looked at Disability sections; other sections explored include Family Benefits (62.5%), Records (50%), Education (37.5%), elsewhere (37.5%)
- Asked post-testing, most users said they expected the 21-686c form to be with Disabilities (71.4%), with two saying they thought Records would be the best place (28.6%) 

**Introduction instruction:**
All participants gave positive assessments of the introduction and confirmation pages – for both layout and content. Most users only scanned the intro; two remarked that they liked the “subway map” arrangement.  Once they began the 21-686c (add spouse & child) and the 21-674 (add student) workflows, several had questions about info they needed to submit the form.

- 75% of all participants wanted some additional information on the intro screen or within the form itself, with 12.5% mentioning the intro screen specifically
- The 674 (add student) flow generated more questions than the 686 (add spouse & child); 75% wanted clarification on prior term schools, 75% had questions about term dates
- Users identified several things they would need ahead of time to complete the form(s): addresses, school dates, marriage details, and student financial info

**Checkboxes an invisible success:**
Participants uniformly understood and accepted the checkbox workflow selection, with 100% quickly selecting the correct choices to complete their given tasks. Users moved quickly past the selections task without hesitation and only a single comment: ”don’t tell me to report.”

- 8 of 8 had no difficulty selecting specific individual workflows
- 4 of 4 had zero difficulty selecting multiple options
- All participants who were asked (4) said they would prefer to complete tasks together rather than submit individual forms per task – even if it meant a longer form

**Easy to use, could be easier:**
All participants (100%) stated they found the form easy to use, though most had at least one question in course of completing their tasks. Indeed, all participants (100%) were observed easily completing their submission tasks. Many commented that the pre-filled fields were helpful.

- 75% (6) of users had at least one instance where they wanted more information; five participants (62.5%) had two or more questions
- Three users (37.5%) suggested additional info in-line with the form (tooltips, help icons & sidebar; only one participant (12.5%) opened any of the “additional info” panels within the form
- 12.5% (2) participants thought the form should be consolidated into fewer screens
- 57.1% (4) of users said the purpose of the accordions at the end of the form were to review and change their entries; 42.9% (3) though they held other info the VA had on record (e.g. service history)

**Help wanted:**
All participants completed their task despite many have one or more questions. There were several places in the form, where multiple users asked for guidance.

- 75% (3) of users who were adding a student (674) wanted clarification regarding term dates
- Three (75%) of 674 users wanted guidance regarding the prior term school
- Two participants (50%) adding a spouse & child (686) had questions regarding marriage types (e.g. proxy)
- 25% (2) of all participants wanted to know the implications of married children within their respective workflows (e.g. “Does it disqualify them?”)

**Confirmation: printing is proof:**
As with the introduction page, all participants gave generally positive assessments of the confirmation page – again for both layout and content. However, many wanted more assurance that their forms were successfully submitted. One user said they would need “proof” when VA “didn’t get their form.”
- Half of all participants (50%) wanted to view, print or download a specific confirmation of their submission; one user expected a printable version of the 21-686c itself (eBenefits has this feature)
- 42.9% (3) of participant cited the need for a dedicated “print” button
- Two users (25%) wanted verbiage addressing site or information security 

**Ctrl + p:**
There were several smaller issues centered on submission confirmation and printing the information set – or even the “official” 21-686c itself. The crux of the confirmation/printing issue is that “proof” will be required if there is a problem processing their submission.

## Additional insights
**Other things we learned**
- Six participants (85.7%) said they would use a laptop or desktop computer to submit and print forms; one user (14.3%) preferred a tablet
- Though many users said they used their phones for browsing websites, none would use their phones for the tasks they were given
- Three Veterans (37.5%) did not know what their service or file number was; one said SSN 
- Two users (12.5%) commented on the green button on the intro page; one saying colorblind people might prefer yellow, the other said they were colorblind, but they knew it was green
- No participant used the back button within the form
- Two participants (12.5%) gave positive comments about the progress indicator

## Recommendations
**What we recommend**
- Maintain the form’s checkbox selection screen; continue to refine and clarify text
- Add guidance, examples and instructions to the marriage types and child marriage sections (686); and to the school term dates, prior school and student address sections (674) of the form
- Continue with the current designed flow of the form, but conduct follow-up usability testing on “live” pages after initial development to uncover pain points
- Add clarifying text to the introduction screen to better identify information needed to complete the form; include implications of potentially “disqualifying” statuses (e.g. married child)
- Investigate “printable form” feature in eBenefits, confirmation IDs,  and “print” button functionality

**Our conclusions**
The 686 is a long and complicated form in its entirety, but the digital version should prove more user-friendly with user-selectable workflows and "step-by-step" chapter-based screens.

- The checkbox selection strategy is acceptable to users who did not pause for a moment before quickly and easily making the proper choices and moving on to the body of the form
- Participants did ask for guidance or clarification at key points of the “add spouse/add child” and add “student workflows;” specifically, they wanted more detailed info on marriage, addresses and dates
- Users were aware of “chapter” changes within the form, and tracked the changes in context
- The longest workflow, “add spouse/add child” was completed quickly; the shorter workflows took almost no time; 100% of users stated the form was easy to use
