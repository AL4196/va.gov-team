# Conversation Guide for 686 usability testing 

## Intro

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about adding and removing dependents to/from your benefits on the VA website. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions

Before we look at the prototype, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Please tell me about your service history.
- Have you been recently married or do you have a child who recently started college?
- What are your experiences adding or removing dependents from you disability claim?
- Are you familiar with the VA 21-686 form? 
    - And what is your experience with the form?

## Screenshare
Will you share your screen with me? I'm going to send you a link. I will be asking you to complete a few tasks using this prototype. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions.

### Things to watch for:
- Take note of how the user navigates (or attempts) to the form

## Fifth Task (if time): Remove

Let's say that your step-child has moved out on their own. How would you go about removing them from your benefits?

OR

Let's say your child graduated college and is no longer eligible for your benefits. What would you do to remove them?

## Post-Task Interview

- What are your thoughts on the length of the form? 
- What are your thoughts on completing a form that requires this type of personal information?
- What would you change about this prototype?

- How would you expect to find this form on the website?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing 

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.
