## Problems solved (What)
### eBenefits Payment History feature
The fundamental problem solved by the Payment History feature is to provide a historical view of payment details to the Veteran or beneficiary. After signing in to eBenefits using DSLogon, users can view their Payment History arranged in two tables, one for payments made, the other for payments returned. 

### Commercial financial account apps
Commercial banks, brokerages, pay apps, etc. also need to provide historical views of account transactions to their users. Typically deposits, payments and withdrawls are displayed in a tabular arrangement. Authentication is required to access account information.

## Customer (Who)
### eBenefits Payment History feature
The key users of the Benefits Payment History feature are Veterans or beneficiaries who are receiving VA payments for diasability, pension or education.

### Commercial financial account apps
A very large number of Americans use commercial financial apps--possibly 80% or more. Considering how common and pervasive such apps are, what can be said with certainty is users have accounts and internet access. 

## Solution
### eBenefits Payment History feature
The eBenefits Payment History feature allows Veterans to view a record of several types of payments online as well as any "returned" payments. If you’re a Veteran, you’ll see a history of your past VA payments for:

- Disability compensation

If you’re the survivor of a Veteran or service member, you’ll see a history of your past VA payments for:

- Survivors pension benefits
- Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (Chapter 35 benefits)

The fundamental problem solved by the Payment History feature is providing a historical view of payment details to the Veteran or beneficiary. After signing in to eBenefits using DSLogon, users can view their Payment History arranged in two tables, one for payments made, the other for payments returned. The table columns include: 

- Date
- Amount
- Type
- Method

Clicking payment dates will link to a corresponding details page where bank name and account number are displayed in addtion ot the info above. The initial sort is by date, latest first.

To allow the user to refine their view of payment tables, View Payments provides two features. The first is a drop-down timeframe filter that allows selection of three, six, or twelve months, or all. The other is sortable columns that display information in an ascending order with the first click, and descending order when the column header is clicked again. This feature has bugs that sometimes cause columns to sort incorrectly.

Some rows expand or link on click to reveal further details about a transaction. Typically, these tables have search and filtering functions to refine the user's view. All modern apps are fully responsive.
