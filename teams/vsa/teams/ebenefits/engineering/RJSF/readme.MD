# Overview

This is a set of recipies for common, more advanced forms you may need to create with the VA fork of the React JSON schema form system. The recipies are organized by the form 'task' you are trying to achieve, for instance if you need to build a form that allows a user to input a few items and then you need a separate page for each of those items to enter more information about that respective item ( this is sometimes referred to as a `list loop` by designers at the VA).
