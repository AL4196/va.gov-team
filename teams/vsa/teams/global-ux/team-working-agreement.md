***Workflow and Processes***


**Standup**
  - Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday @ 11:30 AM- 11:45 AM EST 
  - Tuesday is slack-up day: Team provides updates with relevant tickets to VSA-Public Websites Channel on DSVA Slack
  - 15 min 
  - Start Meeting with Zenhub Board on-screen with VSA-Public Websites Label applied
  - Filter by assignee for indiviual team member to report out on their respective ticket 
     - What ticket you worked on yesterday, what will you work on today, are there any blockers / impediments
     
      
 **ZenHub Pipeline Etiquete**
 - Tickets Within Current Sprint should be worked in the following order:
   * In-Progress- What assignee is currently working on 
   * Current Sprint- Ranked by priority, assignee has conitted to completing work in current sprint and works on after "in-progres" tickets are completed
   * Validate- PRs have been merged awaiting validation on staging / production 
    - Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.
 - Tickets to be worked Outside a sprint:
   * Ready column- After completing current sprint ticket, assignee can pick up ticket to work
   * Backlog- if Ready are all complete, take groomed backlog ticket to work 
 
  
**Team Retrospective**: Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, areas for improvement, what to try doing differently for next sprint 
   - 1st Wednesday (1 hour prior to sprint planning)
   - FunRetro board is provided in advance of retro for current retro, as well as FunRetro board from previous sprint 
   - During Retro, board is up and everyone is given 8 minutes on the clock to write 
   - Product Manager take 2 minutes to de-dupe cards 
   - Once De-duped team has 3 minutes to vote on the cards that have been added
   - Prouct Manager sorts cards based on votes and then team goes through cards starting with:
     - What went well 
     - What didn't go well (how can we improve)
     - Action items (PM reviews and works in process improvements as needed)
   - Speak up! - Even though you may remain annonymous, everyone’s voice matters and should feel comfortable providing feedback
  
  
  **Sprint Planning**: outline team and member focus, goals for sprint
   - 1st Wednesday of every sprint
   - 1 hour duration
   - *Pre-Planning:*  Jennifer, Dave, and Kara confirm priorities prior to the sprint 
     - Kara lists priorities for Jennifer/Dave in writing prior to 1:1 and POs confirm/update during Monday 1:1 meeting
   - Jennifer announces sprint priorities at beginning of sprint planning
 
 
  **Backlog Grooming**: assess and update workload for remainder of sprint
   - 2nd Wednesday of every sprint, duration of 1 hour
   - Reminder at beginning that this is not sprint planning, this is to review any new tickets from the backlog that the team will talk through to ensure each member is understands the ticket and agrees to estimates for tickets in the backlog. Sprint planning is where team members are assigned work. 
   - Estimation is not based on how long something will take to complete, but is rather a combined rating encompassing risk, LOE, and complexity.

    1 - Easy task, work is known, can be executed quickly  
    3 - Medium task, work is known and can be completed in one sprint  
    5 - Work is discussed and planned for, and can be worked   -
    8 - Work is complex, needs to be discussed, and possibly be broken down into smaller tasks 


   
   - Each ticket should include the following:
     - Use of appropriate template for work request (e.g., Redirects, analytics & Insights, etc.) 
     - Title that explains the task
     - Description of work to be done, including any links to wireframes, prototypes, Product Briefs, etc. 
     - Acceptance Criteria - this should be revised after grooming if needed to flush out as will be used as Definition of Done
      - Where appropriate User Stories can include a set of "Tasks" where each task line item has estimate (this can be helpful in providing a better estimate for the ticket)
     - Include any known hard launch dates, or ETAs (this will help in prioritization with Product Owners)  
     - Be sure to Include appropriate labels (always include VSA-Public Websitess, content, FE, IA/Content, etc. 
       -Note: Tickets should have separate labels for content v. product. Labels for both should only be used at the epic level. 
     - Every ticket should be associated with an Epic and include components of the stack: IA/content, FE, etc.  
      - Examples: Legacy, parity, and rewriting work should include Public Websites Label, content & IA, FE (for implementing redirects)
       - Yellow Ribbon should include:  Public Websites, content/IA, engineering (FE), and design
    - If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager or PO and ask for help to work it into the sprint

Team Norms
- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) during 
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

And some logistics:

- Keep as much Slack conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.
- GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to an issue or useful to document, copy them into GitHub.
