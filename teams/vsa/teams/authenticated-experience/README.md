# Executive Summary 

## Mission 

Help users accomplish tasks more easily by leveraging what we know about them as a logged in user.

## User problem statements 

1. I don’t know what I don’t know - what benefits and services can I get access to? 
2. What info does VA know about me and why isn’t it always accurate / consistent? 

## Business goals 

Increase Veteran, Caregivers, Dependents, and others easy access to the benefits they deserve. 

## Questions 

## Assumptions 

## Requirements and Constraints 

- Data in the VA itself is non-standard 
- Contact info currently stored across, EVSS, CORPDB, etc. - many locations, and often conflicting 

## Value Propositions  

## KPIs
