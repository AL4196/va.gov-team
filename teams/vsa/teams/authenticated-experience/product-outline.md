## Overview

The authenticated experience team aims to create a world-class logged-in experience for veterans and their communities on VA.gov (for more on our vision and mission, see the [team charter](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/authenticated-experience/charter.md)). This product outline goes into detail around more specific goals, thinking, and metrics that guide our work.  

## User problem statements 

- **As a veteran, I want to be able to log in to VA.gov and easily find the tools and tasks that apply to my specific experience at the VA.**
- **As a veteran, I want to be notified of status updates and action items that apply to my specific experience at the VA.**
- **As a veteran, I want to be able to log in to VA.gov, quickly complete whatever I came to do, and then get back to the rest of my life.**

## Business goals 

- Create a logged-in experience that makes it easier to find tools and complete tasks.
- Personalize the logged-in experience across pages by elevating contextually-relevant veteran information.
- Create a usable/scalable landing pad for users (ie. logged-in homepage/dashboard) where they can manage their tools/tasks in once place.
- Make it easier to see and manage personal/contact information.
- Establish a foundation for notifications on VA.gov.
- Create a logged-in experience that can eventually be adapted to other user roles and permissions once VA.gov is able to support them.
- Help veterans explore benefits in which they are interested and may qualify. 

## Questions 

## Assumptions 

## Requirements and Constraints 

### Requirements

### Constraints

#### Data
- Data in the VA is complicated and all over the place. Different information is stored across hundreds of databases and is often duplicative or conflicting.
  - EG. Contact info currently stored across, EVSS, CORPDB, etc. - many locations, and often conflicting 
- For data we don't currently have but want, we may need a new ATO to get this information, and this could take a lot of time.
- We don't have a lot of data we want, and we may not be able to get it because it the information isn't digital or is in a database that is a mess/unreliable/will be eventually sunset.

#### Design

- Elements of the logged in experience are set/affected by/affect the logged out experience, so we have to consider this in our work.
- The existing design system is tailored to the needs of unauthenticated content pages. 

## Value Propositions
