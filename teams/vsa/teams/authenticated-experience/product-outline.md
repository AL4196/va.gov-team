## Overview

### Vision

We want to work towards a VA authenticated experience that is so easy and so seamless that it feels like it happens in the backgrounds of people's lives. We want to work towards a future where we truly meet veterans and their communities (families, caregivers, VSOs, etc.) where they are, and where we make them feel seen by, reflected in, and guided through their experience at the VA. There are many ways in which this could unfold, but we see a world in which:

- The service member to veteran transition between DoD and VA is so seamless that it goes unnoticed.
- Veterans and their communities can apply for/enroll in benefits with one click.
- Veterans and their communities can easily interact with the VA through text messages and email.
- The logged-in experience on VA.gov feels like a world-class, private sector experience.

### Mission 

Our current mission is to create a logged in experience on VA.gov that:

- Differentiates itself from the logged out experience.
- Consolidates what we know about veterans and their communities and effectively and efficiently reflects this info back to them throughout the site.
- Guides veterans and their communities towards tasks and tools they need/want to complete.
- Serves up status updates/alerts/action items in a way that makes it easy for veterans and their communities to act on this information.

### North star objectives

- Increase veterans' abilities to manage their benefits online and offline
- Reduce the amount of time it takes to complete tasks in the authenticated experience
- Increase veterans' abilities to see themselves in the authenticated experience
- Improve communication between the VA, veterans, and their communities
