# VSA Research Pilot Participant Guidelines (WIP)

We run a pilot/test session before each study so we can rehearse the process of logging in, working through kinks, and getting familiar with how the study will go. 

## What to expect
- You should receive an invitation for a pilot session from either Perigean or somone from VSP
- You may be given a series of tasks to complete or asked to answer questions about "your experience" with the VA.gov site.
  - Don't worry about pretending to be someone else. Answer the questions truthfully, keeping in mind the target audience for the real study

### Helpful Tips
- Familiarize yourself with the research plan for the study
- Understand who will actually be participating in the study
- Ask questions during the pilot session
- Give the moderator feedback
  - If you have difficulty understanding a question, let the moderator know

Serving as a pilot participant allows you to  view the product through a different lens and see the value in what we're building. Thanks for participating and have fun!
