# VSA Research Pilot Participant Guidelines (WIP)

We run a pilot/test session before each study so we can rehearse the process of logging in, get any conversation guide kinks worked out, understand how to hand off mouse controls, and have a participant show their screen. Developers are encouraged to participate as pilot participants, to get them involved early in the process.

## How it works
You should receive an invitation for a pilot session from either Perigean or somone from VSP

## What to expect

### Helpful Tips
- Familiarize yourself with the research plan for the study you're testing.
