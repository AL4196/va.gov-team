#### Situation
- Accessibility experts and product teams want to address accessibility issues in a timely, non-disruptive manner

#### Complications/Problems/Pain-points
- Global i.e. non-initiative specific findings are sometimes mixed with initiative-specific accessibility findings
- Teams feel that global issues should not be lumped in with addressing accessibility issues on specific intiatives especially when there's a timeline for the initiative
- Teams want the discretion to address accessibility items as it makes sense 
- Both accessibility experts and teams don't want to be surprised by new findings
- Both accessibility experts and teams want to make sure findings aren't "lost" 

#### Solution Hypotheses
- Accessibility experts separate site-wide/global accessibility issues from initiative-specific accessibility issues
- Epics are used as often as possible to capture multiple accessibility findings for both global and initiative-specific issues
- Product teams create consituent tickets within the epic and traceability is guaranteed
