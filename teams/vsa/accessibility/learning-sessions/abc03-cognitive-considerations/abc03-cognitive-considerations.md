## Subject Matter 

We are going to touch on PTSD, mental injuries/illness, and other cognitive considerations. I aim for this to be a safe space where we may speak about these tough subjects, but acknowledge this may be hard.
It’s okay to take a break if you need to. 

## Agenda and intro

* What are Cognitive Considerations?
* Design Considerations
* Technology Solutions
* “~~Just ask for help.~~”
* Accessibility Compliance

### According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health is “a state of well-being in which the individual 

* realizes [their] own abilities, 
* can cope with the normal stresses of life, 
* can work productively and fruitfully, 
* and is able to make a contribution to [their] community”


### In the United States
* 1 in 5 adults experience a mental illness in a given year.
* 1 in 25 adults live with a serious mental illness.
* 6.9 percent of adults live with major depression.
* 18.1 percent of adults live with an anxiety disorder.
* African Americans and Hispanic Americans use mental health services at ½ the rate of whites. 
* Asian Americans at ⅓ the rate of whites.
* LGBTQ individuals are 2 or more times more likely as straight individuals to have a mental health condition.
* Depression and anxiety have a significant economic impact; the estimated cost to the global economy is US$ 1 trillion per year in lost productivity.

### Nearly half (47.7 percent) of all Gulf War II veterans with a disability reported a cognitive difficulty.

### Since October 2001, approximately 1.64 million U.S. troops have deployed to support operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

* A study conducted by the RAND corporation estimates approximately 300,000 veterans who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq are currently suffering from PTSD or major depression, and about 320,000 may have experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI) during deployment.
* Approximately 18.5 percent of U.S. service members who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq currently have post-traumatic stress disorder or depression; and 19.5 percent report experiencing a traumatic brain injury during deployment.

### What do you think of these stats?

## What are Cognitive Considerations?

### A disability is a condition that limits a major life activity. 

### Accessibility helps more than just the blind 

There are five disability types that are commonly considered in digital accessibility: 
* seeing
* hearing
* speaking
* moving 
* thinking

“Thinking” includes disabilities that impact emotions, problem-solving, memory, and other ways we use our brain.

### “Thinking” disabilities

Cognitive disabilities are by far the most common type of disability and may arise as a result of:
* congenital conditions from birth
* developmental conditions from a young age
* traumatic injury, infections, chemical imbalances, or other conditions later in life

They may also be situational considerations attributed to fatigue, environmental stimulus, or being new to a situation.

### Some types of cognitive disabilities

### Cognitive disability spectrum

- There are so many different kinds, and so many variations. 
- An individual may experience a deficit in only one area, rather than all of them. 
- Some trends or categories are worth listing, not because they apply to everyone, but because they are part of the cognitive disability spectrum.

### Functional disabilities

We consider cognitive disabilities by functional disability. Functional disabilities ignore the medical or behavioral causes of the disability and instead focus on the resulting abilities and challenges. Cognitive disabilities impact the capacity of an individual to:

- think
- concentrate
- react to emotions
- formulate ideas
- problem solve
- reason
- remember

## Design Considerations

### Limited Comprehension

Most people with cognitive disabilities experience limited comprehension of one kind or another. 
- They may not be able to understand complex ideas. 
- They may have difficulty with metaphors or abstract language. 
- They may not understand some kinds of slang or idiomatic expressions. 
- Some people with cognitive disabilities have exceptionally high cognitive functions in one area — the ability to remember numbers or conversations — but low cognitive functions in other areas, such as social skills or emotional awareness.

### Considerations for lower comprehension

Users who have lower comprehension will have a better experience if the interface and content are easy to use and understand. Too many options and complex information may be difficult for them to process.

- Simplify the interface as much as possible (reduce content, provide structure). 
- Simplify the content as much as possible (i.e., PlainLanguage.gov). 
- Keep content to short sentences, bullets, good summarizing headings.
- Keep videos and audio as short as possible.
- Limit the number of choices on the screen.
- Provide help features, especially contextual help.
- Design for ease of use, anticipate possible errors.
- Test the usability of the interface with actual users, preferably including users with cognitive disabilities.

Here's an example on VA.gov where we might apply the above considerations to improve the experience for those with lower consideration (and everyone):

### Short-Term Memory Loss

Some people with cognitive disabilities have a hard time remembering things from one moment to the next. Their brains don’t allow them to focus on new information, so they don’t retain it in the short term. 

Long web processes — such as online purchasing procedures, account sign-up procedures, or setting preferences — can cause users to forget what they were doing, or to lose track of information that they may need to remember from one step to the next. 

VA.gov example: see the [526 form](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/)

Notice the long loading indicators with no information about what is loading. We could rewrite our loading messages to be more specific about what page we're waiting on, or have text on the page that doesn't rely on the data being called.

### People with memory loss

A website that has predictability across all its pages (same navigation, same structure, etc.) will greatly benefit users with memory loss. Sites that are too complicated may fatigue users with memory loss. If users have difficulty interacting with the web page, help features can assist them with navigating the web page.

- Retain information across screens, and within a path.
- Provide help features, particularly contextual help.
