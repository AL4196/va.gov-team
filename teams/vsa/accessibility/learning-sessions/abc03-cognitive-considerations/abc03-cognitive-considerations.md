## Subject Matter 

We are going to touch on PTSD, mental injuries/illness, and other cognitive considerations. I aim for this to be a safe space where we may speak about these tough subjects, but acknowledge this may be hard.
It’s okay to take a break if you need to. 

## Agenda and intro

* What are Cognitive Considerations?
* Design Considerations
* Technology Solutions
* “~~Just ask for help.~~”
* Accessibility Compliance

### According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health is “a state of well-being in which the individual 

* realizes [their] own abilities, 
* can cope with the normal stresses of life, 
* can work productively and fruitfully, 
* and is able to make a contribution to [their] community”


### In the United States
* 1 in 5 adults experience a mental illness in a given year.
* 1 in 25 adults live with a serious mental illness.
* 6.9 percent of adults live with major depression.
* 18.1 percent of adults live with an anxiety disorder.
* African Americans and Hispanic Americans use mental health services at ½ the rate of whites. 
* Asian Americans at ⅓ the rate of whites.
* LGBTQ individuals are 2 or more times more likely as straight individuals to have a mental health condition.
* Depression and anxiety have a significant economic impact; the estimated cost to the global economy is US$ 1 trillion per year in lost productivity.

### Since October 2001, approximately 1.64 million U.S. troops have deployed to support operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

* A study conducted by the RAND corporation estimates approximately 300,000 veterans who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq are currently suffering from PTSD or major depression, and about 320,000 may have experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI) during deployment.
* Approximately 18.5 percent of U.S. service members who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq currently have post-traumatic stress disorder or depression; and 19.5 percent report experiencing a traumatic brain injury during deployment.

### What do you think of these stats?

## What are Cognitive Considerations?

### A disability is a condition that limits a major life activity. 

### Accessibility helps more than just the blind 

There are five disability types that are commonly considered in digital accessibility: 
* seeing
* hearing
* speaking
* moving 
* thinking

“Thinking” includes disabilities that impact emotions, problem-solving, memory, and other ways we use our brain.

### “Thinking” disabilities

Cognitive disabilities are by far the most common type of disability and may arise as a result of:
* congenital conditions from birth
* developmental conditions from a young age
* traumatic injury, infections, chemical imbalances, or other conditions later in life

They may also be situational considerations attributed to fatigue, environmental stimulus, or being new to a situation.
