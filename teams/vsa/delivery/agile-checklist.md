Use this checklist to assist you with your Ceremonies and process. 

## Stand Up

1. Log in at least 1 minute before the meeting.
2. If needed, pull up the Zenhub board so tasks can be seen.
3. Pick someone to start.
4. Remind the team of 3 question format if it hasn’t been followed recently.
5. End within 15 minutes, making sure everyone has had a chance to speak. 

## Sprint Planning 

**Pre-Planning**

1. Open the Capacity Tracker and have it ready to share. 
2. Pull up past velocity for review. 
3. Verify that the columns past Current Sprint and In Progress are empty.
4. Log in at least 1 minute before the meeting. 

**Planning**

1. Kickoff the call once everyone joins and go over the velocity of the past Sprint. This will give the team an idea on how many Stories they think they can complete in the upcoming Sprint.
2. Go over the team Capacity by getting everyone’s availability over the next Sprint.
3. Speak about and display the goal of the Sprint. 
4. Share Zenhub board for team and start with the Backlog (this is usually the Ready Column but may start at the Backlog Column).
5. Starting with highest priority User Story:
...Make sure the Story is clear and see if anyone has questions about it.
...Have team decide who will work on item.
...Move to Current Sprint Column.
...Create tasks for the User Story and estimate hours per task.

**Implementation**

1. After User Stories are committed to, check with the capacity tracker to confirm that the team is not over or under committed. 
2. Verify with team and get commitment that this is the work they will complete during the Sprint. 

## Backlog Grooming/Refinement

1. Prior to meeting, add new User Stories if they have not been added yet. 
2. Open the team Zenhub board, and start with the next Tasks that are not in the current Sprint.
3. Allow the PO to present the goal for the next Sprint. If not the PO, then you will provide the goal of the next Sprint. 
4. Go through each Story:
5. Add new tasks.
6. Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
7. Change priority.
8. Change Acceptance Criteria if needed.
9. Confirm with the team that the Backlog looks ready for the next two Sprints.



## Sprint Retrospective

**Review**

1. Open and review the previous Retro Board and action items. Discuss the action items and confirm they were attended to. 
2. Ask the team if they agree that the items were resolved.

**Facilitate**

1. Start the timer for 5 minutes to allow the team to fill out the Retro board. 
2. Share the board (if previously hidden) and start going over each item in the Went Well column. Celebrate the victories and make sure the team knows that they have improved.
3. Go over each item in the To Improve column.
4. Read out the item and ask for someone to speak to it. Give time to allow someone to speak up. 
5. Get thoughts on the item and have others give their thoughts. 
6. After all items are discussed, set up a timer (2 min usually) for people to vote on the items they think are most important. 
7. Pick 2 or 3 of the top voted on items and discuss an Action item for each one. 
8. Make sure the action item is well defined, detailed, and can be completed before the end of the next Sprint.

**Implementation**

1. Assign an individual (or have someone volunteer) to be tasked with completing this action item. Do not assign an action item to the whole team, it must be an individual. 
2. Confirm with the team on the action items and the commitment to complete them.
