Delivery of VSA work currently happens in 2 week sprints, informed by high level objectives set on a quarterly basis. There are planning sessions that occur on the Sprint planning day before each new sprint, so that teams can collectively plan out their Sprint objectives and the work needed to achieve them. 


# Sprint Objectives

There are a handful of key goals for VSA Sprint Objectives:

1. Via the act of setting them, serve as a gut check that your prioritizations and the evolution of your features and services are in line with the strategic objectives of VSA overall.

2. Give DSVA an idea of what you'll be taking on and why (i.e. the impact you hope to achieve with that work) so they can provide feedback based on their priorities and based on other VA-wide info they may be aware of.

3. Via transparency into our planning and status report, enable DSVA to perform their contractual duty and pay us based on how well we fulfilled our commitments.

4. Surface opportunities for cross-collaboration, and spur cross-team discussion where needed.

## How to brainstorm Sprint Objectives

1. Review VSA OKRs and your team OKRs to think about how you want to align to the overall strategy
1. Review DSVA recommendations to see if there’s anything your team may want to do to contribute
1. Review your team's Backlog to see if there’s anything high priority to start pulling in
1. Review prior Sprint to see if any work needs to continue, or if you need to change course to align per ^
1. Check your team’s upcoming Capacity to see if you need to cut back accordingly
1. Check anticipated support needs, and when high volume is expected, cut back on other work accordingly

## How to write Sprint Objectives
- State an intended outcome and value proposition, not an individual task.
- Format: _We will..._ [Verb] _______ so that [intended  audience] can ________.
- They should usually be small enough that they will be acheived in 1 Sprint.
- Link objectives to the epic they are a part of
- Don't be _too_ ambitious in the volume and scope for the sprint, leave about 20% space for unexpected work or challenges.
- Move any good ideas that you want to keep track of but won't be focusing on this sprint to your ZenHub backlog to evaluate in the future.


# Agile Ceremonies

## Ceremonies Overview

VSA teams work in a 2 week cycle known as a Sprint. During a Sprint, the team assigns and commits to tasks that can be completed within this time frame. In order to deliver the best business value, there are multiple Agile Ceremonies in the Sprint.  Agile Ceremonies are timeboxed meetings that happen throughout the Sprint. The ceremonies include **Daily Standup, Sprint Planning, Backlog Grooming, Sprint Review,** and **Sprint Retrospective.** Below are the descriptions of each. 

Details on the ceremonies can be found in the [Agile Ceremonies Overview Page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/delivery/agile-ceremonies-overview.md)

## Ceremonies Checklist

In order to make sure value is attained in each ceremony, VSA teams also have an [Agile Ceremonies Checklist Page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/delivery/agile-checklist.md).
