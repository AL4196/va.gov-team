2. Is there a plan in place when you're OOO? Would someone else be doing the final Content Q/A support? 

--TBD. need to discuss with platform team. 

3. Should we be using the ```content``` or ```content-ia-team``` label when creating a Content Review issue?

--For final content Q/A review, please use content-ia-team label. 

4. Are there any resources you could share with the global-ux content team about how to create a Github branch and pull request? 

--Yes, I'll be providing a training to the global-ux content folks week of 8/26

5. We'll be reaching out to the global-ux team for our content writing needs, should we include you on those issues or just when we need a final review?
