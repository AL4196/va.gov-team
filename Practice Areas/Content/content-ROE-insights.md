### Questions and feedback on the Content Review document

Feeback and questions from meeting with VSA PMs: 

1. Can we add request a content review from within a pull request? Or does it always have to be in an issue? 

2. Is there a plan in place when you're OOO? Would someone else be doing the final Content Q/A support? 

3. Should we be using the ```content``` or ```content-ia-team``` label when creating a Content Review issue? 

4. Are there any resources you could share about how to create a Github branch and pull request?
